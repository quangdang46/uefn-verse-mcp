# Post Process Devices

Add effects to set a mood or enhance your game mechanics.

![Post Process Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/96fcd5a8-c77f-4fd6-b813-0754dcbf6bd9?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

**Post-processing** refers to customizable filters that you can use to create specific visual effects. Most of these filters primarily affect lighting.The **Post Process** device provides a way to apply these different effects on your island.

You may recognize some of the effects from the **camera filters** in **Island Settings** under the [**World**](world-settings-in-fortnite-creative) category, but this device provides even more options.

For a Post Process effect to work correctly, make sure the **Camera Filter** option in the World category is set to **Default (none)**.

Apply these effects to a specific player, throughout an entire island, or set up different effects to happen based on user interactions or activation by other devices. You can also set the effect to remain indefinitely, or to turn off after a specified time or based on [event bindings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-post-processing-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

You can control transitions between different effects or from no effect to effect and back again by using the **blend** options to set how an effect blends from one state to another.

These effects can be used to simulate or enhance environmental factors or character moods or attitudes.

For help on how to find the **Post Process** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [**Event Browser**](event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Effect Options

| Effect | What It Looks Like |
| --- | --- |
| **None**: How things look with no effect applied. |  |
| **Oak**: Washes out the color and shadows and applies subtle outlines. |  |
| **Dark**: Makes things look pretty danged dark. Good for creating a night setting. |  |
| **Film Noir**: Gives everything a washed-out black-and-white effect. |  |
| **Film Warm**: Warms up the appearance by increasing the yellow. |  |
| **Happy Place**: Uses a cheerful palette that makes your island scene look fun! |  |
| **Pixelizer**: Pixelizes the image in a way that conjures up old video game consoles from last century. |  |
| **Red**: Gives everything a red hue. |  |
| **Sepia**: Gives the scene a reddish-brown hue, like an old Wild West photograph. |  |
| **Crazy**: This effect makes your players want to emote like no one's watching! The solarization effect reverses colors in unexpected ways. |  |
| **Retro**: Outlines images with a glowing line. |  |
| **Spooky**: Desaturates the colors just enough to create an edgy feeling. |  |
| **Neon Party**: Applies a neon glow to things, but more subtly than the retro effect does. |  |
| **Horror Movie**: Washes out color, but less so than the low exposure effect. |  |
| **Old Cartoon**: Applies outlines similarly to Comic, but in black and white. It also adds a static effect that simulates old film moving through an analog projector. |  |
| **Desolate**: Deepens shadows regardless of time-of-day setting, which creates a feeling of foreboding. |  |
| **Halftone**: A bright effect that uses a texture similar to Comic and Neocomic. |  |
| **CCTV**: Shows a low-fidelity image in monochrome as though you're watching over a closed-circuit security camera. |  |
| **70s Print**: This effect is reminiscent of a Polaroid snapshot that has faded over decades. |  |
| **Action Lines**: Dynamic lines radiating outward from the character and action. This effect can convey excitement when a character reacts to something dramatically. |  |
| **Comic**: Applies an outline to details. |  |
| **Low Exposure**: Washes out much of the color and contrast, the way an underexposed photo would. |  |
| **Neocomic**: Intensifies contrast, and adds subtle outlines. |  |
| **Nightvision**: Seeing the world through night-vision goggles makes this effect great for stealth games or missions. |  |
| **Radial Blur**: Creates a blur effect that radiates from a central point. |  |
| **Simple Blur**: Makes everything blurry. What the world looks like when some people take off their glasses. |  |
| **VHSfilter**: What things look like when a VHS tape that was played too many times, this is an effect that conjures a vibe from last century, right down to static on the screen and moving bands of color. |  |
| **Vignette**: An effect that simulates darkening in a real-world camera lens.Vignetting is mostly noticeable near the edges of the image. |  |
| **Heatwave**: A shimmery effect that mimics looking at things in extreme heat such as in a desert area. |  |
| **Rain**: Shows raindrops as though on the surface of the camera lens. This is useful when you're creating a rain environment, or when the camera is coming out of water. |  |
| **Frost**: An effect like frost on a window pane. It's primarily around the edges. |  |
| **80s Cartoon**: Applies outline similarly to Comic, but with brighter and flatter colors. |  |
| **Comic Noir**: Applies an outline like Comic or Old Cartoon, but has no static and includes a white border around the entire game screen. |  |
| **Heavy Linework**: Applies a black and white comic book filter with heavy linework around assets and characters on screen. |  |
