# User Interface Settings

Control what your players see in-game.

![User Interface Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d2717f5b-70fd-4cc5-97a3-98123b89a89e?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

In a **Fortnite Creative** game, a **user interface** is how players receive information from the game. This includes the [heads-up display](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#hud), or **HUD**, player **nameplate** information, **maps**, and the **scoreboard**.

From the **Island Settings** tab, click the **User Interface** category, then click a **subcategory** to expand it.

[![User Interface is a category under the Island Settings tab.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d4725b88-92b5-41e6-af92-cf5631ad2542?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d4725b88-92b5-41e6-af92-cf5631ad2542?resizing_type=fit)

Any changes you make to these settings are automatically saved. You can restore the settings to their original values at any time by clicking the **Restore Defaults** button. This will reset only the settings for your current tab.

Following are the User Interface settings and how you can modify them.

Some settings are grayed out. This usually indicates that another setting must be changed before that setting is available.
