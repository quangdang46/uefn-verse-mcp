# Skydome Devices

Change your island from bright and sunny, to cloudy, to eerie alien skies or dark and spooky nights.

![Skydome Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/593483ab-584c-402e-b4bf-787f8bf8d128?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The S 14 Time of Day Manager and the Skydome device are being retired in an upcoming release. Create custom lighting with the [Day Sequence device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/day-sequence-device-in-fortnite-creative) as well as the [Ambience settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/world-settings-in-fortnite-creative#ambience-settings) available in World Settings.

Opting into the new TODM is **not reversible**, backup or duplicate your island before opting into the new lighting settings.

The **Skydome** device controls how the sky looks, as well as giving you options for changing the sun, clouds, stars or other objects in the sky above your island. You can experiment with the sun and moon, and add other atmospheric elements like stars, fog and clouds. You can change the color of your light source, and blend different colors for your island’s sky to create the perfect atmosphere for your game.

Setting options in the Skydome device will override sky and atmosphere options in the [My Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) settings.

Here are some of the things you can do with this device:

- Create a moonlit night for a spooky game.
- Change the color of the sky to simulate being on another planet.
- Change the color of the moon, or the visibility of the stars.
- Add clouds to the sky, and customize the speed and direction of those clouds.

## Channels

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by [transmitting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) a [signal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) on a specific [channel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary). The receiving device needs to be set up to [receive](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#receive) the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who [triggered](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#trigger) the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.

### Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.

| Option | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Enable When Receiving From** | **No Channel**, Pick a channel | Enables the device when it receives a signal on the selected channel. |
| **Disable When Receiving From** | **No Channel**, Pick a channel | Disables the device when it receives a signal on the selected channel. |
