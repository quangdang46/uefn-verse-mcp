![5 Rounds of Econ Lessons](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/57c83d0b-6813-4e62-82ef-08a95a513384?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

In the **5 Rounds of Econ Lessons Gameplay Example**, you create an island where your player completes five timed rounds that pit them against waves of monsters. Your player is given a basic weapon at the start and is awarded gold. At the end of each round, they are able to bring some or all of their gold to the next round, and on the final round, will have all acquired weapons and gold taken away from them at the start of the round.

This is a demonstration of how the [Round Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) device is used to drive the [game's economy](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#economy-game) on a round-to-round basis. After completing this gameplay example, you will understand how to use the Round Settings device with other devices to create a simple economy in Fortnite Creative. This example also demonstrates the [enabling](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#enable) and disabling of different Creature Spawners in each round, through signals sent on channels.

## Putting It All Together

When a player plays your Island, they begin the game with a basic weapon. They are granted 50 gold. Using the starting weapon, they eliminate four Fiends, then approach the Vending Machines; only the two Vending Machines selling uncommon weapons are active. They buy a weapon, then wait for the timer to run out, or press the button to end the round.

In Round 2, the player is granted another 100 gold, and uses the new gun to eliminate four Brutes. They can then buy from the Vending Machines selling rare and epic weapons. They buy a weapon, then wait for the timer to run out, or press the button to end the round.

In Round 3, the player loses half of their remaining gold, and uses the gun they bought in round three to eliminate another four Brutes. If they bought the cheaper rare weapon in Round 2, they have enough gold to buy a legendary gun. If they bought the more expensive epic weapon in Round 2, they don't have enough gold to buy a legendary weapon. Whether or not they buy a weapon, they wait for the timer to run out, or press the button to end the round.

In Round 4, the player loses all their remaining gold, and uses their weapons to eliminate four more Brutes. They then wait for the timer to run out, or press the button to end the round.

In Round 5, the player loses all their weapons, and uses the granted starting weapon to eliminate four Fiends, just like in Round 1. They then wait for the timer to run out, or press the button to end the game.
