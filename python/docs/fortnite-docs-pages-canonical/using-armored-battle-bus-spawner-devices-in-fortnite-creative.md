The **Armored Battle Bus** is a battle-hardened addition to available vehicles. Creators can [place](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) an Armored Battle Bus on the island to a specific location and orientation. This vehicle has unique features, including:

- Up to 3 players can man the vehicle — one driver and two players on turrets mounted in the front and rear of the bus.
- It can instantly destroy vegetation, rocks, and most buildings when a player drives the bus into them.
- Turrets mounted on the Armored Battle Bus are equipped with scopes.
- It can interact with the Fuel Pump Device for refueling.

For help on how to find the Armored Battle Bus Spawner device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use *italic* for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.
