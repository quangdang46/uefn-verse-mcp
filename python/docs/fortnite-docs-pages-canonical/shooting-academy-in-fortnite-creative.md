3. Click on the **Legendary Combat Assault Rifle**, then click **Equip** to add it to the [Equipment bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary).
4. Click, hold, and drag the rifle icon from the Equipment bar until the orange [backpack icon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#backpack-icon) appears, then release.

## Playing Your Game

After you successfully create the Shooting Academy tutorial and play your level, you’ll see other uses for the Barrier and Shooting Gallery devices. Use the barrier device options to enable and disable barriers using the channel system.

Target dummies not only move side-to-side, but also up and down, and all movements in a random pattern depending on how you edit the target’s options.
