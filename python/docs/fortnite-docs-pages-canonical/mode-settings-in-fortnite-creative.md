# Mode Settings

Explore Creative island settings that directly affect gameplay for this island!

![Mode Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/abb1a66f-0b2a-4e62-a1ed-2169d26765d0?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

A **mode** is how you see or experience something. In **Fortnite**, a [game mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#game-mode) is about who can play, and how.

The Mode settings are where you can set things like when and how your game starts, where and when players can spawn into the game, how to assign and track scores, and other factors that influence or control gameplay.

Under Mode, there are a number of subcategories you can modify to change gameplay, and many of these subcategories have multiple settings. From the **Island Settings tab**, click the **Mode category**, then click a **subcategory** to expand it.

[![Select the mode category from the Island Settings tab.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7a1a32ba-995b-403d-9832-12bf7c760967?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7a1a32ba-995b-403d-9832-12bf7c760967?resizing_type=fit)

If you know the name of a setting you want to change, use the **search bar** to find it.

Island settings provide a baseline for your game, but some device settings, such as Team Settings & Inventory and [Class Designer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-class-designer-devices-in-fortnite-creative), can override these settings.

Any changes you make are automatically saved. You can restore the settings to their original values at any time by clicking the **Restore Defaults** button. This will reset only the settings for your current selected category.

The following sections describe the settings available in each subcategory, and how you can use them.

Some settings are grayed out. This usually indicates that another setting must be changed before that setting is available.
