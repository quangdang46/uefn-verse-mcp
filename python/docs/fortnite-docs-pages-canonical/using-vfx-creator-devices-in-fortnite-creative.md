# VFX Creator Devices

Create and modify your own customized visual effects.

![VFX Creator Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/868abd4f-1f48-4177-8eac-d6e6ec2c05ac?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

Use the **VFX Creator** to create and customize your own [visual effects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#vfx),
using a library of [sprites](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#sprite), and with lots of ways to modify them.

This device is more flexible than the [VFX Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-vfx-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative), which gives you a selection of pre-made visual effects to choose from but limits how much you can customize or change those effects.

The VFX Creator creates a [sprite particle effect](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#sprite-particle-effect). You have a large variety of [sprites](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#sprite) to choose from, and a lot of ways to customize how the particle effect works and what it looks like. Using this device, you can create unique effects for your game.

Ways you can use this device include:

- Highlight an in-game event, such as the beginning or end of a race, or the completion of an objective.
- Make eliminating a boss even more spectacular and satisfying.
- Create a particular atmosphere on your island, or emphasize a fantastical aspect of your game.
- Create environmental effects like rain or leaves.
- Create interesting trail effects by attaching the VFX to a player.

**Looking for a spark of creative freedom?** See [**Down But Not Out Device Design Example**](down-but-not-out-device-design-example-in-fortnite-creative) to liberate your imagination!

To find the VFX Creator device, go to the **Creative inventory** and select the **Devices** tab. From there, you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see [Finding and Placing Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the [Customize panel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#customize-panel) and make options easier to manage and navigate. However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, any values in our device docs that trigger contextual filtering are in *italic*.

All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like choosing the sprite for the effect, and choosing the color and brightness of the effect. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like choosing a secondary color and determining whether the effect loops.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.
