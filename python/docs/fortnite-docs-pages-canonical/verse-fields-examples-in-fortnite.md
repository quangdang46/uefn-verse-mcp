# Verse Fields Examples

Learn how to use Verse fields to create custom UI for your next project.

![Verse Fields Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/840e1e66-8fc6-4310-a4d7-f1ec532d7ba4?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

Verse fields can be defined directly in UMG. Variables are created in a User Widget then bound to widget properties in the Verse code. Variables pass Verse data and are reflected in the asset digest, they also provide a way to create custom dynamic UI without relying on device view models.

## In-Island Transactions UI Example

The storefront example expands on the Marketplace API by adding custom UI elements through Verse fields and Verse UI. Data is passed from the API to a data layer, and a Verse class is used to track players and respond to players purchasing objects.

The following files in the template create the look of the custom UI:

- `shop_setup_device_template` - This file defines the `var Shop` and calls the `ShowUI` function to display the UI coded in the `ui_shop` file.
- `ui_shop` - A class that consolidates all widgets into a Verse file through Verse UI. UMG handles the character image, item details, headers and price, and rows of items. The Verse API handles the background layers and buttons.
- `ui_shop_offer_item` - A class to add to the View button of each item row.
- `link_volume_to_shop_device` - A device script that uses the Volume device as a trigger to show  the shop interface.

All materials, textures, and user widgets used with this example are in the **UI** > **Verse** > **InIslandTransaction** folders.

### Shop UI

The design for the main shop UI is coded in an OverlayRoot. The OverlayRoot uses a material block to call the material instances for the background materials of the Main background and the offer background.

Verse

Shop UI

```
set OverlayRoot = overlay:
            Slots := array:
                overlay_slot:
                    Widget := BackgroundWidget                      
                    VerticalAlignment := vertical_alignment.Fill
                    HorizontalAlignment := horizontal_alignment.Fill                    
                overlay_slot:
                    Widget := CloseButton
                    Padding := margin {Left := 824.0, Bottom := 30.0}
                    VerticalAlignment := vertical_alignment.Bottom
```

A second overlay widget is added which contains a Stack Box. The Stack Box is used to create the body of the offers. The final Stack Box slot is reserved for the `OfferDetailsOverlayRoot` which is a User Widget that contains the design for the details.

Verse

Shop UI

```
 overlay_slot:
                                Widget := stack_box:
                                    Orientation := orientation.Horizontal
                                    Slots := array:
                                        stack_box_slot:
                                            Widget := stack_box:
                                                Orientation := orientation.Vertical
                                                Slots := array:
                                                    stack_box_slot:
                                                        Widget := HeaderWidget
```

### PopulateOffers

The `PopulateOffers` function creates the number of item rows entered for each item listed in the  `OfferItemWidget` creating a repeatable action that works for each offer in the Stack Box. For example, if you have three offers, this function creates three offer widgets for each of your items.

Verse

PopulateOffers

```
    PopulateOffers(InOffers:[]offer) : void =
       
        for (Offer : InOffers):

            var OfferItemWidget : ui_shop_offer_item = ui_shop_offer_item {}
```

 PopulateOffers(InOffers:[]offer) : void =
for (Offer : InOffers):
var OfferItemWidget : ui_shop_offer_item = ui_shop_offer_item {}

For each offer, the `UpdateSelectedOfferDetails` function updates the following data:

- Name
- Icon
- ShortDescription
- PriceFloat

Verse

PopulateOffers

```
    UpdateSelectedOfferDetails(SelectedOffer : offer) : void =

        var PriceFloat : float = 0.0

            if (PriceVB := price_vbucks[SelectedOffer.Price]):
                set PriceFloat = GetPriceVBucks(PriceVB)
```

The `HandleBuyButtonClicked` method sends the player into the Epic Games payment workflow when the player makes a purchase.

Verse

PopulateOffers

```
    HandleBuyButtonClicked(SelectedOffer : offer) <suspends> : void =
       
        BuyButton.OnClick().Await()
       
        if (PlayerUI := GetPlayerUI[Player]):
            HideUI(PlayerUI)
       
        BuyOffer(Player, SelectedOffer)
```

 HandleBuyButtonClicked(SelectedOffer : offer) <suspends> : void =
BuyButton.OnClick().Await()
if (PlayerUI := GetPlayerUI[Player]):
HideUI(PlayerUI)
BuyOffer(Player, SelectedOffer)

### Device Trigger

In this example, a [Volume device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-volume-devices-in-fortnite-creative) is used as a trigger to open the shop UI. You can use any device as a substitute trigger. Or no device at all. Players can approach items individually and the UI will pop-up.

Verse

Link Volume to Shop

```
# A Verse-authored creative device that can be placed in a level
link_volume_to_shop_device := class(creative_device):

    @editable
    var ShopTemplate:shop_setup_device_template = shop_setup_device_template{}
    
    @editable
    var OfferVolume:volume_device = volume_device{}
```
