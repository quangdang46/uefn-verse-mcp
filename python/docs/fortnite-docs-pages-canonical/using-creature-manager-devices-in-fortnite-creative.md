![Creature Manager Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f9b0c25c-f690-457a-ad0b-6bd35370c0eb?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The **Creature Manager** device provides a way to customize one creature type at a time.

You can place a Creature Manager for each type of creature you use. By customizing this device, you can control things like the type and amount of damage a creature does to players, to the score a player receives for eliminating that type of creature.

By itself, this device does nothing. To spawn creatures, pair Creature Manager devices with [Creature Spawners](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-creature-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) or [Creature Placers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-creature-placer-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

To find the Creature Manager device, go to the **Creative inventory** and select the **Devices** tab. From there, you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
