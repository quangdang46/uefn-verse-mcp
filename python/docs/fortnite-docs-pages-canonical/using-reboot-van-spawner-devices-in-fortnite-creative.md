# Reboot Van Spawner Devices

Place a device that spawns Reboot Vans in your islands to give players a way to revive eliminated team members!

If you've ever wished you could use the **Reboot Vans** from Battle Royale on your own island, now you can! You can place the **Reboot Van Spawner** around your island to give players a way to revive eliminated teammates. Eliminated players drop **Reboot Cards**, and their teammates can pick up the cards if there is a Reboot Van available that they are eligible to use, then use them at the van to restore player health.

For help on how to find the Reboot Van Spawner device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options
