Use this device to offer players respawning [vehicle mods](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-vehicle-mod-items-in-fortnite-creative) to attach to the following vehicles:

- [Armored Battle Bus](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-armored-battle-bus-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) (excluding Bulletproof Tire mods)
- [Armored Transport](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-armored-transport-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

The Repair Box mod is compatible with all vehicles.

Vehicle mods are alterations that will automatically attach to the triggering vehicle. These mods can help you navigate terrain, damage the environment and other players, and repair the triggering vehicle.

By default, the Vehicle Mod Box Spawner will spawn a random vehicle mod type when your game starts and will randomly switch to a different mod when respawned. You can recognize the vehicle mods by their box icons and the names that appear over the box.

Place these mod boxes on your island and instruct your players to run over the mod boxes to apply the mod to the triggering vehicle.

Pair the **Vehicle Mod Box Spawner** device on your island with a vehicle, such as [Fang Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-fang-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative), as an easy way for players to modify to attach to their vehicles when they drive over the box..

You can even place [Vehicle Service Station](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-vehicle-service-station-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices to allow players to refuel their vehicles in your drivable gameplay.

## Vehicle Mods

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in *italic*.

All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.

| **Enable When Receiving From** | Enables the device and starts the spawn timer. While the device is enabled, it can spawn vehicle mod boxes, which players can interact with. |
| **Disable When Receiving From** | Disables the device and clears any active spawn timers. When disabled, it will be hidden and mod boxes will not spawn. |
| **Spawn Box When Receiving From** | Spawns a mod box. If a mod box is already spawned, it despawns the first one without triggering **On Box Destroyed**. The device must be enabled for this setting to work. |
| **Despawn Box When Receiving From** | Disables the device and clears any active spawn timers. While disabled, it will be hidden and the vehicle mod boxes will not spawn. |
