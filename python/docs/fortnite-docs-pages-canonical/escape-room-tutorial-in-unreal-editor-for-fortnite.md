Learn how to create a custom escape room.

![Escape Room](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dde3cfd7-918c-4a53-926d-81401498f17a?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

This **escape room game** tutorial guides you through designing a uniquely styled game by creating custom assets, building Verse puzzles, and selecting and placing prefabs, gallery items and devices for your escape room. You’ll also see how to create player classes that strengthen players and prepare them for the ultimate battle at the end.

There are a lot of steps to this tutorial because you're learning not only how to use UEFN, but also how to code in Verse for some of the more sophisticated device interactions.

The gameplay can last as long as 10 minutes for a single player. The player gathers points by completing tasks during the escape and is rewarded bonus points for completing some tasks that aren’t central to their escape. If you complete each section, you'll come out the other side with a whole new level of understanding!

## Before You Begin

The escape room features a number of custom assets and puzzles that you can recreate and personalize for your own project by following these documents:
