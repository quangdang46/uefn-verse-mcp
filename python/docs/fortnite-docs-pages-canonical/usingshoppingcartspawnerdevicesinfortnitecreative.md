The **Shopping Cart Spawner** is a type of [vehicle spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#vehicle-spawner) that can [spawn](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#spawning) one vehicle per device. Use the shopping carts for navigation challenges, cart racing, or any kind of vehicle-related gameplay.

For help on how to find the **Shopping Cart Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like whether the device is visible during the game. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like what happens when the device is enabled or disabled, and how long a spawned vehicle can be in deep water before it is destroyed.

## Channels

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by [transmitting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) a [signal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) on a specific [channel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary). The receiving device needs to be set up to [receive](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#receive) the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who [triggered](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#trigger) the device with the signal.

This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.
