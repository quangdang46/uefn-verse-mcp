# Video Player Devices

Spice up your gameplay by adding videos!

![Video Player Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/222e75df-bdaa-4c42-9ec5-d070acbdaee1?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

You can add media to your gameplay with the **Video Player** device that incorporates Fortnite-themed music videos. You can also set up these devices to be controlled by players or other devices.

Though multiple instances of the same video can be shown, only one video stream can play at a time.

You can use triggers, such as [Timers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-timer-devices-in-fortnite-creative), to automatically play a video through [events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#event) like **Enable When Receiving From** and **Disable When Receiving From**.

Through settings like **Interact Time**, you can also control whether players can directly turn videos on or off.

You can customize the video presentation by changing the device's shape, and adjust the distance at which the videos can be heard.

To find the Video Player device, go to the **Creative inventory** and select the **Devices** tab. From there, you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see **[Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite)**.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in *italic*.

All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options
