# Crafting Items

Use crafting items as resources for players to collect and exchange during gameplay.

![Crafting Items](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a72a7bf1-95c5-4aa2-af49-36390315413b?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

Offer **crafting** items to players throughout gameplay as an island resource that can be collected and exchanged. Players cannot directly consume these items, but can collect them to simulate [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#crafting) by exchanging them for other usable items.

Crafting items are:

- **Animal Bones**
- **Stink Sac**
- **Mechanical Parts**
- **Cube Monster Parts**

Though more items are considered crafting items, only these items will show on the top row of the **Resources** bar as shown in [Managing Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative).

These items could be required along with another to unlock requirements for [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#device) like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

*Use the devices like Conditional Button and Item Granter to create the system of crafting.*

You could pair **Animal Bones** with **[Rough Ore](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-mineral-ore-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)** as requirements needed to craft weapons like the **Primal Pistol**.

To do so, you will need to set the Conditional Button's setting **Key Items Required** to **2** and pair the device with an [**Item Granter**](using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to grant the usable item.

You can also blend items with [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#prop) of similar [themes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) from the **Galleries** and **Prefabs** tab.

For example, you can blend Cube Monster Parts with props from the **Crashed Abductor Gallery** to fully immerse players onto your island.

To create the process of crafting, you will need to either [spawn](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#spawning) or [grant](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#grant) items onto the map for players to collect with the **Item Spawner** or **Item Granter**.

Players can collect these items to exchange for usable items through devices like Conditional Button, which consumes equipped items. They can also use these items to craft other items that will build up to a larger item.

## Finding and Placing Items

[![Finding Crafting Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/61e562ec-a1bd-49fe-a110-94de992866fd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/61e562ec-a1bd-49fe-a110-94de992866fd?resizing_type=fit)

*Click image to enlarge.*

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Resources bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#resources-bar). (When you're back in Create mode, you can view items in your Resources bar by pressing the **Tab** key and selecting **Play**.)

[![Crafting Items Chest Tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0cfd1cf9-3e53-4516-b0a1-f2cf0fd60c0e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0cfd1cf9-3e53-4516-b0a1-f2cf0fd60c0e?resizing_type=fit)

*Click image to enlarge.*

You may want to offer an item bundle to players through a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#chest) or [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#llama). Selecting **Add To Chest** will add the item to the [Chest tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary). Each time you click it, the item count will increase by one, shown in a yellow box on the **Chest** tab.

From the **Chest** tab, you can select either **Create Chest** or **Create Llama** to store the items in a Chest or a Llama for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#in-game).

You can add up to fifteen items to the **Chest** tab. When it’s full, the **Add To Chest** tab will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the **Chest** tab.

## Managing Items

You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#play-inventory). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. In the PLAY inventory, you can create or split item stacks, or remove them entirely from your Resources bar.

[![Crafting Items Resources Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/590cc33e-7ecb-41eb-87f7-2ef69ccf12ae?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/590cc33e-7ecb-41eb-87f7-2ef69ccf12ae?resizing_type=fit)

Instead of dropping these items on the ground, it's best to grant them to players by using item-granting devices like the Item Spawner.

You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either *Respawn* or *Back To Hub* from the *Menu*. When you do this, your inventory clears.

## Registering Items

[![Pairing Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/896c3b8f-3c8f-462b-b1e8-25c44a43acd2?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/896c3b8f-3c8f-462b-b1e8-25c44a43acd2?resizing_type=fit)

You can drop items directly onto devices that can either hold or grant items. Above shows the Conditional Button, which holds two crafting items and an Item Granter that holds one usable item.

This pair of devices can be set up for players to exchange Animal Bones and Rough Ore for a Primal Pistol. To do so, these items must first be [registered](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#register) to the devices that will hold the information.

[![Registering Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/aee0a2a7-65e5-45ab-afe2-2ba4fe06a915?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/aee0a2a7-65e5-45ab-afe2-2ba4fe06a915?resizing_type=fit)
