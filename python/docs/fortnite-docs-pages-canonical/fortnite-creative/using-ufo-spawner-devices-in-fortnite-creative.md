- Use UFO Spawner devices in combination with the [Race Checkpoint Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#race-checkpoint) to design a racing game for your players.
- You can place a player directly inside the UFO using a trigger.

## Channels

When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by [transmitting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) a [signal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) on a specific [channel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary). The receiving device needs to be set up to [receive](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#receive) the signal on the same channel.

A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who [triggered](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#trigger) the device with the signal.

When the UFO Spawner device receives a signal on a channel, it can be enabled or disabled, can spawn or destroy a vehicle, and assign a driver. It can transmit a signal on a channel when a player enters or exits the vehicle, and when the vehicle is spawned or destroyed.

### Receivers

Receivers listen for a channel and perform an action when they hear any device (including themselves) send a signal on that channel.

| Option | Value | Description |

| **Assigns Driver When Receiving From** | **No Channel**, Pick a channel | Sets the player that [instigated](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#instigator) the signal as the spawned vehicle's pilot |
| **Respawn Vehicle When Receiving From** | **No Channel**, Pick a channel | Spawns a new vehicle after receiving a signal on the selected [channel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary). The existing vehicle will be destroyed before a new vehicle spawns. |
| **Destroy Vehicle When Receiving From** | **No Channel**, Pick a channel | When receiving a signal on the selected channel, the spawned vehicle is destroyed if it exists. |
| **Enable When Receiving From** | **No Channel**, Pick a channel | When a signal is received on the selected channel, the UFO spawner is enabled. |
| **Disable When Receiving From** | **No Channel**, Pick a channel | When a signal is received on the selected channel, the UFO spawner is disabled. |

### Transmitters

Transmitters send a signal on the selected channel when triggered.

| Option | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **When Player Enters Vehicle Transmit On** | **No Channel**, Pick a channel | Transmits a signal on the selected channel when a player enters the spawned vehicle. |
| **When Player Exits Vehicle Transmit On** | **No Channel**, Pick a channel | Transmits a signal on the selected channel when a player exits the spawned vehicle. |
