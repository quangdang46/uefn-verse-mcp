# Volume Devices

Use the Volume to create large areas where events can be triggered upon entering or exiting.

![Volume Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8a639279-f1c2-4486-b664-9d0a17db53fc?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

Have you ever wanted to trigger specific devices or events for a whole area of your island? The **Volume** device is designed to help you do that. As a customizable and nestable [volume](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#volume), you can size and place multiple volumes that can trigger events or functions when a player, vehicle, creature, wildlife animal, or guard enters or leaves that volume.

There are lots of ways to use this device, but they work particularly well with the **Fixed Point Camera**, **Fixed Angle Camera**, and **Third Person Controls** devices. See [Designing with Cameras and Controls](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/designing-with-cameras-and-controls-in-fortnite-creative) for more examples for how to use this device with camera and controls devices.

## Direct Event Binding

[Direct event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#direct-event-binding)  allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas.

Below are the functions and events for this device.

### Functions

This device has no functions.

### Events

An [event](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#event) tells another device when to perform a function. In UEFN, events are not editable. In Creative, follow these steps to set an event.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **On Enter Send Event To** | When a valid entity enters the volume, an event is sent to the selected device, which triggers the selected function. |
| **On Exit Send Event To** | When a valid entity exits the volume, an event is sent to the selected device, which triggers the selected function. |
| **On Physics Enter** | When a physics prop enters the volume, an event is sent to the selected device, which triggers the selected function. |
| **On Physics Exit** | When a physics prop exits the volume, an event is sent to the selected device, which triggers the selected function. |

## Using Volume Devices In Verse

You can use the code below to control a Volume device in Verse. This code shows how to use events and functions in the Volume device API. Modify it to fit the needs of your experience.

Verse

```
using { /Fortnite.com/Devices }
using { /UnrealEngine.com/Temporary/Diagnostics }
using { /Verse.org/Simulation }

# A Verse-authored creative device that can be placed in a level
volume_device_verse_example := class(creative_device):
    
    # Reference to the Volume device in the level.
    # In the Details panel for this Verse device,
    # set this property to your Volume device.
```

To use this code in your UEFN experience, follow these steps.
