## Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Fixes

Fixes:

- VFX Pickaxe CadetFrog: Fixed the TOD night yellow color so that impacts are now non-directional.
- VFX Emote LanternStroll: Edited material to reduce artifacting, and adjusted daytime brightness.

## Device Updates and Fixes

New:

- Added Ash VFX from Fortnitemares Haunted POI to VFX Spawner Device.

Fixes:

- Ch5 Time of Day Manager: Identified and removed a fog start distance value that prevented fog from appearing closer than 100 meters to the camera, affecting medium and low platform scalabilities. This fix allows creators to adjust the fog settings through the Day Sequence device and visualize fog closer to the camera across all platforms. It's recommended that you balance fog density and max opacity, and dial to taste while adjusting viewport scalability in UEFN.
- Fixed an issue where Guards / AI couldn't pass through shield bubbles.

## UEFN Updates and Fixes

Fixes:

- The Impulse on Hit Multiplier option now correctly disables when Impulse on Hit option is disabled.
- Stopped changing the rendering mode when resetting to defaults in the settings screen.
- Tamed Hive Lobbers from the Wildlife Spawner now show the expected overhead icon that conveys that they are tamed.

## Verse Updates and fixes

Fixes:

- No more Verse and json files being added in sys folder under UEFN project directory.
- Verse vectors are now copy / pasted in engine format.
- The Verse compiler now errors when initializing a field after calling a delegating constructor in an archetype expression. This fixes missing validation, and now correctly enforces Verse’s object construction semantics.

For example, the following is now a compiler error:

Verse

```
base_class := class:
    # base_class fields

MakeBaseClass<constructor>() := base_class:
    # base_class initializers

derived_class := class(base_class):
    Field:int

MakeDerivedClass<constructor>() := derived_class:
```

The fix for these errors is to move the delegating constructor call below all field initializers - move `MakeBaseClass<constructor>() below Field := 42`.

Live islands will still function as they are, but you will need to fix your object construction semantics using the method above to republish.

## Unreal Revision Control Fixes

Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where 'Check-In Changes' sometimes failed without any error reported back to the user.
- Fixed an issue where 'Resolve Conflicts' sometimes failed because a file was still in conflict.
- Fixed an editor stall that would last until VS Code was closed.
