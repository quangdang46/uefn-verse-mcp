The **Damage Volume** device is great for raising stakes by dealing damage or eliminating players who step where they shouldn't!

Read on to see three ways you can put this device into action on your island.

## Parkour Play Zone Boundary

This simple parkour gameplay uses a Damage Volume device to eliminate any players who fall to the ground.

### Devices Used

- 1 x [Damage Volume](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-damage-volume-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
- 1 x [Player Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device

### Build Steps

### Design Tip

This is a useful technique for creating quick and easy respawns when a player goes somewhere they should not. As opposed to a **Barrier** device, which just stops the player, the **Damage Volume** device can more strongly deter a player from going into specific areas by damaging or eliminating them.

## Prevent Spawn Camping

This island shows Damage Volume devices being used to eliminate players who are trying to [spawn camp](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#spawn-camping).

Each spawn area has a Damage Volume device that you'll configure to eliminate any player not on the spawning team.

### Devices Used

- 2 x [Damage Volume](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-damage-volume-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices
- 4 x [Player Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices

### Build Steps

### Design Tip

This technique can be used with as many teams as you want, and will prevent anyone who is not on a spawning team from entering that spawn area. This could also be accomplished with the **Barrier** device, but once again, the Damage Volume can be a stronger enforcer against spawn-camping players.

## Triggered by Players

This simple **floor-is-lava** game mode uses a Damage Volume device that players trigger during gameplay. The core game loop is set up so that when the Button is pressed, the Damage Volume is enabled and its “Selected Team” setting is set to the team of the player pressing the Button. The Damage Volume has the “Invert Team Selection” setting enabled, meaning that it will damage all teams except for the triggering player’s team. The Button will also trigger the Timer, which disables the Damage Volume after 15 seconds.

### Devices Used

- 1 x Damage Volume device
- 2 x Player Spawner devices
- 1 x [Button](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
- 1 x [Timer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-timer-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
