# Prop Hunt Template

Use this multi-step tutorial to create a Prop Hunt game that's customized with Verse.

![Prop Hunt Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/25195168-2ef5-4ece-b2f2-1634648b8c9f?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

In **Verse Prop Hunt**, the hunters have to find and eliminate a team of players who disguise themselves as props and hide.

Each round, players will start in the lobby. When the game begins, the teams are randomly selected. For the first 15 seconds of gameplay, the team of hunters wait in the pre-game lobby while the team of props hide.

Props will take damage and be eliminated once a player from the hunting team shoots them. Eliminated props will respawn in the lobby as hunters.

Props that do not move for 15 seconds will emit a heartbeat VFX and SFX, alerting hunters to their location. To avoid detection, props should continuously move.

Props will be awarded points for each second survived while hunters are awarded points for each elimination. The hunter’s awarded points increase as more props are eliminated. This makes for more exciting gameplay as the last prop awards the most points.

Enter the island code **0259-6053-5824** to play and see the **Verse Prop Hunt** template’s mechanics in action. The Verse Prop Hunt template itself can be found in the **Featured Examples** section of UEFN (Unreal Editor for Fortnite).

This tutorial will demonstrate some basic features:

- Player added/removed events
- Loops: for and loop
- Classes
- Asymmetrical teams
- Custom Events

Unlike the Creative [Prop Hunt](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/design-a-prop-hunt-game-in-fortnite-creative) tutorial, this tutorial uses Verse to make certain features possible.

By using Verse in this tutorial, you can:

- Handle players joining and leaving the game.
- Define the number of hunters per total player count.
- Keep a counter of props and end the round when all props are destroyed.
- Iterate information for all the players in a game.
- Increase the hunter’s score with each elimination relative to the number of props remaining.
- Read via a script rather than tracing functionality through events/channels over devices that relate to each abstractly through the UI.
- Use fewer devices in the scene.
- Review the `@editable` properties and tweak the behavior of the script without needing to understand Verse.

Follow these steps to learn how to link devices with Verse to create a multiplayer prop hunt game with asymmetrical teams that rotate each round.
