# Third Person Controls Devices

Use the Third Person Controls device to remap or reconfigure player controls while you are using camera devices.

![Third Person Controls Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/30fce60b-77bb-4298-bafd-355360bda498?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The **Control: Third Person** (Third Person Controls) device is designed for use alongside the [Fixed Angle Camera](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-fixed-angle-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative), [Fixed Point Camera](using-fixed-point-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative), and [Orbit Camera](using-orbit-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices. The Third Person Controls device has two main functions:

- Configuring movement and facing settings for players affected by camera devices
- Configuring targeting behavior for players affected by camera devices

Because the camera devices change what the player sees, the usual controls for movement and other player actions will be different. This device is where you determine the direction the player faces, how they target enemies or objects for interaction, how fast they move, and so on.

To learn more about how to use the camera and controls devices together, see [Designing with Cameras and Controls](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/designing-with-cameras-and-controls-in-fortnite-creative).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use *italic* for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

Configure this device with the following options.

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.
