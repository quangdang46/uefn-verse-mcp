# Taxi Spawner Devices

Place a Taxi vehicle in your game for your players to drive.

![Taxi Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7572293b-ec1a-45ea-a4ea-0f81f7304b60?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

A **Taxi Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#spawning) a Taxi vehicle onto your island at the spawner's given location and orientation. 
Use Taxi Spawner devices in combination with the [Race Checkpoint Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#race-checkpoint) to design a racing game for your players. You can place a player directly inside the Taxi using a trigger.

For help on how to find the **Taxi Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like boost [regen](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#regen) and whether the radio is enabled. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like whether the Taxi vehicle takes damage from [collisions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary), how much damage it can take before being destroyed, and how much damage it deals when it explodes.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.
