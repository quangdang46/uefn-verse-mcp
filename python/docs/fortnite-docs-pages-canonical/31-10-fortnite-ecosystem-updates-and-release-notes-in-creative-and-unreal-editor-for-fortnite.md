# 31.10 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes

31.10 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes in Creative, Unreal Editor for Fortnite, and Verse

![31.10 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e0e14267-9868-47b0-8bd1-9fc772d29db5?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The v31.10 update introduces new device design examples in the Fortnite Creative documentation, as well as fixes for the issue affecting UEFN experiences converted from Fortnite Creative. We're also replacing the "Early Access" tag with "Beta" to better reflect features that are still in progress but stable enough to use.

## Updated Feature Tags: "Beta" Replaces “Early Access”

We're updating our terminology. The "Early Access" tag will be replaced with "Beta," following Unreal Engine's convention. **Beta** means you're getting early access to features or devices that are still under development, but which are stable enough to use effectively in your published islands. This means you can explore a feature and provide feedback, helping us improve it for final release. The "Experimental" tag remains unchanged, indicating features with no compatibility guarantees, and publishing with Experimental features is still restricted.

## New "Clicks" and "Plays" Metrics in the Creator Portal

You can now track both clicks and plays for your island in the Analytics tab! These new metrics let you see how many clicks your thumbnails are getting and how many times your island is played each day.

## New Device Design Examples

We've added more new device design examples to the [Fortnite Creative documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/device-design-examples-in-fortnite-creative?lang=en-US) focusing on different ways to use game mechanics that showcase different Creative devices. The following is the list of new device design examples. Take a look at these examples for inspiration on fresh ways to use Creative devices!

[D-Launcher Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/d-launcher-device-design-examples-in-fortnite-creative):

- **Parkour Traversal**: Use the D-Launcher as a traversal mechanic in a simple parkour challenge.
- **Hazard Ahead**: Because the D-Launcher device can launch a player in any direction, it also works as a hazard for players to avoid. In this example, players must avoid touching launchers that are set to launch them away from the parkour area.
- **Skeet Shooting**: Launcher devices can launch more than just players — they can also launch wildlife and creatures! This example uses creature-launching, along with a low-gravity function, to create a simple skeet-shooting mini-game.

[Down But Not Out Device Design Example](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/down-but-not-out-device-design-example):

- **ooperative mountain-climbing game**: In this example, the objective is to occupy the capture area at the mountain's summit for a specified time to win the game, with players working cooperatively to achieve the objective. You will learn how to build a cooperative mountain-climbing game where players have to rely on each other to overcome the dangers of the mountain and reach the summit!

More examples are routinely added to this section of the Creative documentation, so keep a lookout!
