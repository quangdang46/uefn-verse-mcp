The **AI Navigation Modification** device creates a volume or zone that defines where [AI](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) enemies cannot access.

You can use this device to control which areas AI enemies can enter and which they are excluded from. You can even dynamically change spaces where AI enemies can enter or patrol. This device can also help you route paths around complex geometry that AIs have difficulty navigating.

Some examples of how you might use this device are:

- You have AI enemies patrolling where there is a hazardous area, and you want the AI to avoid that hazard so they don't take damage from it.
- You want to give or take away AI enemy access to a particular area in your island based on a specific event or other trigger.
