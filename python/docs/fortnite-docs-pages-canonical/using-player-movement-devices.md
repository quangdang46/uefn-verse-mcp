# Player Movement Devices

Use the Player Movement device to customize the way players move on your island based on the island’s gameplay mechanics, gameplay cameras, teams, and more.

![Player Movement Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b22457b2-7bab-4cb7-8577-4ca6054d78f3?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

This feature is in an experimental state so you can try it out, provide feedback, and see what we are planning. Please keep in mind that we do not guarantee backward compatibility for islands using the device during the experimental stage, the APIs for these features are subject to change, and we may remove entire experimental features or specific functionality at our discretion.

The **Player Movement** device manages different types of movement through movement attributes. The customized movement determines how players move beyond what is controlled through **Island Settings.** This, in turn, adds a level of control to the island that creates a unique feeling to the in-game experience and supports different game genres.

The Player Movement device does not:

- Customize the player input or relevant animations.
- Override specific movement configurations to a certain gameplay item or vehicle.

Only one Player Movement Settings device can be actively used on one player at a time.

You can easily preview the movement changes within **[Edit mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#edit-mode)** so there’s no need to playtest the result. Previewing customized player movement settings in Edit mode can restrain your movements while editing. For example, actions like toggling **Fly** will be affected by any edits made to flight specific settings.

Use this device to:

- Create gameplay movements similar to Fortnite Ballistic with the use of the [First Person camera devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-first-person-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
- Create gameplay movement that complements the [Fixed Angle Camera](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fixed-angle-camera) and [Fixed Point Camera](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fixed-point-camera).

To find the **Player Movement** device, 
go to the **Creative menu** and select the **Devices**category. From there you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the **[Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).**

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in italic.

All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

All movements can be customized individually or together based on Fortnite BR Classic movement styles and Fortnite Ballistice movement styles. Individual movements have broad customization options.

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.
