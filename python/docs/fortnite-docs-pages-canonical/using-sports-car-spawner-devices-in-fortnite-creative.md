![Sports Car Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c6c9140d-ff1d-4d2e-9638-2c32c5a666bc?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

A **Sports Car Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#spawning) a sports car vehicle onto your island at the spawner's given location and orientation.

## Vehicle Skin Options

Players have full control over their own car [cosmetics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#cosmetics) through their [lockers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#locker). Any cosmetics a player is awarded or purchases for Rocket Racing is available in the player's locker. The RR vehicle will spawn with the selected car cosmetics when a player drives the vehicle.

The selected [skin](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#outfit) has no effect on the vehicle's performance.

For help on finding the **Sports Car Spawner** device, see [**Using Devices**](using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

- Use Sports Car Spawner devices in combination with the [Race Checkpoint Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#race-checkpoint) to design a racing game for your players.
- You can place a player directly inside the sports car using event binding.

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
