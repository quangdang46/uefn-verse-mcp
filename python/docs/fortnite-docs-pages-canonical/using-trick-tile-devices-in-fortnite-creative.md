A **Trick Tile** is a [trap](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#trap) device that destroys the tile it's placed on when activated.

This trap can be attached to a standard floor, stairs, wall or ceiling tile. You can set it to remove the building piece it's attached to when a player steps on it, or set other conditions by using triggers. You can also set the device so that the removed tile will reset to its initial state in some conditions.

## Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like setting an activation delay, and triggering on contact with a player. Additionally, there are some advanced options, like making some teams or players safe, or changing the activation and reset times.

When a Trick Tile is placed, it is enabled by [default](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#default) when the game starts, and it stays invisible. There is a two-second delay before it removes the activated tile, and during this time it bounces, with colored warning effects.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are **bold**.

### Basic Options

| **Trigger on Player Contact** | No, **Yes** | Determines whether or not the device is triggered when a player makes contact with the attached tile. |
