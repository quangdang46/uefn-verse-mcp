# Player Settings

Control how players interact with other players and the environment.

![Player Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a4f3aa48-a0cb-4c88-bab9-adb457500add?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

There are a number of ways you can modify how **players** interact with your island, from how gravity affects them to whether they can build. All of these options contribute to the player experience.

There are many Player subcategories, and each one has multiple settings. From the **Island Settings** tab, click **Player**, then click any **subcategory** to expand it.

[![The Player category has a slew of subcategories.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8cffa73d-5635-4889-a66e-4bb8d341b87f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8cffa73d-5635-4889-a66e-4bb8d341b87f?resizing_type=fit)

If you want to modify a specific setting and know the name of that setting, use the **search bar** to find it.

Any changes you make to these settings are automatically saved. You can restore the settings to their original values at any time by clicking the **Restore Defaults** button. This will reset only the settings for your current selected category.

The following sections describe the settings available in each subcategory, and how you can use them.

Some settings are grayed out. This usually indicates that another setting must be changed before that setting is available.
