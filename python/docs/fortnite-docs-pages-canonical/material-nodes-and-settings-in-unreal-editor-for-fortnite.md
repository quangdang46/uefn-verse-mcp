# Material Nodes and Settings

Learn how material nodes work and how to set them in a material instance.

![Material Nodes and Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2e9c20ed-5c2b-4d9a-b2e5-04332b3103b1?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

Before jumping into the tutorials, familiarize yourself with [**Essential Materials Concepts**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/essential-unreal-engine-material-concepts/), the [**Material Editor User Guide**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine-material-editor-user-guide/), and the [**Material Editor UI**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine-material-editor-ui/). These pages provide the background knowledge about creating a material instance and the Material Editor.

**Base Color**, **Metallic**, **Specular**, and **Roughness** are the foundation of how materials work in UEFN.To better understand how you want materials to look and behave, refer to [**Physically Based Materials**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/physically-based-materials-in-unreal-engine/). This page explains how the different inputs of the **Main Material Node** (or the Material root node) work and interact with one another.

To understand how to use input pins on the Main Material node, refer to [**Material Inputs**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/material-inputs-in-unreal-engine/). The page describes how different pins help create specific types of surfaces.

## Material Properties

A material defines the properties of a surface, and a shading model defines how the surface interacts with light.

For the most part, the material properties in the Material Editor Details panel won’t change when you're making materials for meshes. Change the Material Domain setting when creating a material that interacts with players through user interfaces (UI), [post processing](unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#post-processing), or lighting. Below are the default settings to use when starting out.

| Property | Setting | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Material Domain | Surface | Defines how the material will be used. **Surface** defines how the material on the surface of the mesh. |
| Blend Mode | Masked | Defines how the output of the material will blend with pixels behind it. **Masked** creates a mask over the mesh. |
| Shading Model | Default Lit | Defines how the surface material makes the final color by setting how the material interacts with light. Default Lit shading is good for any solid mesh. |

When you become more comfortable with material creation, play with these properties to change how the material interacts and sits on the mesh.

If you are creating a material for a hollow mesh or one that is two-sided, check the option for **Two Sided** to create a secondary color for the backside of the mesh, which is perfect for creating a material for something thin, like the leaves of a plant.

## Nodes

UEFN uses Material nodes to create Materials and textures, or to turn into Material Instances so parameters you set in the material can be refered to in devices, post processing, lighting, UI, and more. The Material Editor opens with a [**Main Material node**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/using-the-main-material-node-in-unreal-engine/) which takes additional Material nodes into its input pins. By assigning values to the Material nodes, you define the color of an asset, [how the color looks on the asset](https://docs.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine-material-expressions-reference/), and how the [texture acts on the asset](https://docs.unrealengine.com/using-texture-masks-in-unreal-engine/).

Depending on the material nodes you choose, you can use textures and [UVs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/customized-uvs-in-unreal-engine-materials/) in your material to create interesting effects like blinking lights, or wind blowing through your foliage.

Use the **Base Color input** of the [**Main Material node**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/using-the-main-material-node-in-unreal-engine/) to see what the different nodes do. The Main Material node can even take [Float](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/verse-glossary), 3Vector, or 4Vector values from a **Default Color** node.

Drag and drop a material instance onto your mesh in the viewport. Reduce the size of the Material Editor window and you can edit your mesh material nodes live without having to compile.

The table below lists the most commonly used nodes. Edit the node values and plug them into the Main Material node to see what they do.

So if a value of 0.2 is input into a Ceil, it rounds the value up to 1.0. |  |
| [Named Reroute node](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6de5510b-8033-4c00-ac0c-628df066a6d0?resizing_type=fit) | Named ReRoute node | Provides a way to name the node and reroute material nodes.

The more you experiment with the nodes, their values, and which attributes you want to affect, the better you will become at creating custom Materials and textures. Understanding how to use values is key for creating Materials. Use the Material you create on meshes you import, or on meshes you made using [Modeling Mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/modeling-mode-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

Materials and textures can even be used with the [Cinematic Sequence device](cinematic-sequence-device-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to create custom effects on meshes as well.

When creating a new Material, watch the stats of your Material. No Material should have more than 500 instructions on one Material. Otherwise, you will have a data-heavy Material that will likely fail to render properly.

[![Ensure instruction stats don’t exceed 500](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9de00b8f-f231-4916-8751-d4065724fb65?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9de00b8f-f231-4916-8751-d4065724fb65?resizing_type=fit)

Learn the basics of Material creation by referring to [**Creating Shiny Material**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/creating-shiny-materials-in-unreal-engine/), [**Using the Emissive Material Input**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/using-the-emissive-material-input-in-unreal-engine/), and [**Using Transparency in Materials**](https://docs.unrealengine.com/using-transparency-in-unreal-engine-materials/). These tutorials cover basic Materials that are shiny, metallic, light infused, and working with less opaque Materials.
