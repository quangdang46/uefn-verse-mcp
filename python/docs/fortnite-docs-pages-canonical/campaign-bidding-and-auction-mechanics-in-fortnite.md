# Vehicle Service Station Devices
If your island has vehicles, use this device to give players a way to repair and refuel them.

The **Vehicle Service Station** can automatically repair and refuel any vehicles that drive into the station. Players don't have to get out to interact with the station or use an item. You can determine how much fuel is provided and how quickly vehicle damage is repaired.
For help on how to find the [**Vehicle Service Station**] device, see [**Using Devices**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [**Event Browser**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
