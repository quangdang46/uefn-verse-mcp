# Timed Objective Devices
When this device is triggered, it starts a countdown. If it reaches the end of the countdown, it sends a message on a specific channel.
![Timed Objective Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/334d54ea-3aef-4d1b-9879-b9d2ce7cb555?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The Timed Objective device is for [game modes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mode) where players can start or stop timers to advance [gameplay](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#gameplay) [objectives](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#objective), such as Attack/Defend Bomb objectives.
For help on how to find the **Timed Objective** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

##  Design Examples
Here are some examples of how you can use the Timed Objective device.
  * [Door Open](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-timed-objective-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
  * [Switch Delay](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-timed-objective-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

###  Door Open
One of the most useful functions of the Timed Objective is using it to send signals after a preset period of time.
**Devices used** :
  * 1 x **Timed Objective**
  * 2 x [Prop Mover](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-prop-mover-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

  1. Create a simple enclosed arena. Use two props for the doors in a closed position.
  2. Attach a **Prop Mover** device to each of the movable doors. Make sure to orient the movement arrow so each door opens in the appropriate direction. Customize them both to the following settings:
[![Door Prop Movers](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a7c5e59-4a6e-4bdf-b47f-e88686e7916d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a7c5e59-4a6e-4bdf-b47f-e88686e7916d?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
Distance |  2 Meters |  The doors will move 2 meters.
Speed |  1 Meter/Second |  The doors will move at 1 m/s.
Time From Start |  Off |  The Prop Movers will not automatically activate after an amount of time has elapsed from the start of the round.
On Prop Collision Behavior |  Continue |  Any contact with other props that the doors make while moving will be ignored.
Prop Damage On Collision |  None |  Props impacted by the doors will not take damage.
  3. Place a **Timed Objective** device anywhere on the island. Customize it to the following settings:
[![Door Timed Objective Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a435fef-1aa9-40cb-a4ef-109d468c1587?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a435fef-1aa9-40cb-a4ef-109d468c1587?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
Timer Label Text |  Doors Open In... |  This HUD message is shown during the timer countdown.
Urgency Mode Start Time |  3 |  The countdown sounds become more noticeable with 3 seconds left.
  4. Set the direct event bindings of the Timed Objective to the following:
[![Door Timed Objective Events](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bb6c5d08-1243-491b-8d0e-46fd61ce4cd7?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bb6c5d08-1243-491b-8d0e-46fd61ce4cd7?resizing_type=fit)
Function  |  Device  |  Event  |  Description
---|---|---|---
On Completed Send Event To |  DoorPropMover1, DoorPropMover2 |  Start |  When the Timed Objective completes, the doors will begin moving.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A  |  Function  |  Device B  |  Event  |  Explanation
---|---|---|---|---
**DoorPropMover1, DoorPropMover2** |  Start |  **TimedObjective** (w:95) |  On Completed Send Event To |  When the Timed Objective completes, the doors will begin moving.
You now have the basic functionality for sending delayed signals from the Timed Objective device.
There are countless ways to take advantage of the Timed Objective device to delay signals anywhere from seconds to minutes. From causing events to take place at a predetermined time after the start of the game to starting the countdown from a separate signal, it’s an essential part of the Creative toolset that's easy to use and offers a lot of flexibility.
Use direct event binding to start your countdowns on a signal from another device, and make sure **Completion Behavior** is set to **Reset** or **Restart** if you want it to be usable more than once.
###  Switch Delay
Another form of gameplay you can explore is creating switches that will start an interruptible countdown after a brief interaction, allowing players to try to control a point long enough to end a round in their favor.
**Devices used** :
  * 1 x **Timed Objective**
  * 1 x [**Switch**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-switch-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
  * 1 x [**End Game Device**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-end-game-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

  1. Create a small arena with a place for a Switch device where it can be contested.
  2. Place a **Switch** and customize it to the following settings:
[![Switch Delay Switch Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d32e8c4c-04cb-4924-bbcc-49dd8de9d81c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d32e8c4c-04cb-4924-bbcc-49dd8de9d81c?resizing_type=fit)

Timer Label Text |  Team A wins in... |  The HUD will display this text during the timer countdown.
Timer Sound Distance |  Whole Map |  The timer can be heard throughout the entire map regardless of player proximity.
  4. Place an **End Game Device** anywhere on the island. Customize it to the following settings:
[![Switch Delay End Game Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d3a99723-dd33-4855-b8e7-f58471fe1d04?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d3a99723-dd33-4855-b8e7-f58471fe1d04?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
Custom Victory Callout |  Team A wins via timeout! |  If the timer concludes, then Team A is the victor and this message will be shown.
  5. Set the direct event bindings of the Switch to the following:
[![Switch Delay Switch Events](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0246f1ec-52e8-4054-aed9-63d82e26fa58?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0246f1ec-52e8-4054-aed9-63d82e26fa58?resizing_type=fit)
Function  |  Device  |  Event  |  Description
---|---|---|---
On Turned On Send Event To |  TimedObjective |  Start |  When the Switch is turned on, the Timed Objective will start.
On Turned Off Send Event To |  TimedObjective |  Stop |  When the Switch is turned off, the Timed Objective will stop.
  6. Set the direct event bindings of the Timed Objective to the following:
[![Switch Delay Timed Objective Events](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/610c8d6d-c386-4316-b8d3-c633f73ed390?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/610c8d6d-c386-4316-b8d3-c633f73ed390?resizing_type=fit)
Function  |  Device  |  Event  |  Description
---|---|---|---
On Completed Send Event To |  EndGameDevice |  Activate |  When the Timed Objective successfully completes, the End Game Device will end the game.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A  |  Function  |  Device B  |  Event  |  Explanation
---|---|---|---|---
**TimedObjective** (w:95) |  Start |  **Switch** |  On Turned On Send Event To |  When the Switch is turned on, the Timed Objective will start.
**TimedObjective** (w:95) |  Stop |  **Switch** |  On Turned Off Send Event To |  When the Switch is turned off, the Timed Objective will stop.
**EndGameDevice** |  Activate |  **TimedObjective** (w:95) |  On Completed Send Event To |  When the Timed Objective successfully completes, the End Game Device will end the game.
You now have the basic functionality to create an interruptible countdown with a Timed Objective device.
It is very common to use the **Start** function and **On Completed Send Event To** event when connecting a Timed Objective to other devices. The method shown here can be an alternative to point-building [domination](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#domination)-style games, where a point only needs to be held for 15 seconds without the player who's interacting getting eliminated.
There could be multiple places unlocked before the End Game Device is triggered, with high-speed gameplay based around more competition on the Switch than other devices.
