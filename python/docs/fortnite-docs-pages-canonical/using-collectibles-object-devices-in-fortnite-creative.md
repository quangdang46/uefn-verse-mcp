# Collectibles Object Devices

Place themed, customizable resources for players to collect throughout gameplay.

![Collectibles Object Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/aa073487-2e41-426e-baa9-a954f78ac6ec?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The **Collectibles Object** device provides a variety of collectible objects that you can use as **[economy drivers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary)**, or [mediums of exchange](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary). You can also use these items as objectives that drive gameplay.

When used as an economy driver, these items can trigger item granting devices like the [Item Granter](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/item-granter) when collected. Through item granting devices, you can offer usable items, weapons, or items like **[Gold](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-gold-items-in-fortnite-creative)** whenever the collectible is picked up.

For example, whenever a player picks up a **Music Note**, it can trigger the player to collect a Boogie Bomb through the Item Granter.

You can also use the items from this device as a win condition through either points or item accumulation:

- Change the **My Island > Game** settings for either **Collect Items to End** or **Score to End** to use collectible items as gameplay objectives.
- To use the **Collect Items to End** setting, set the amount of items required to be collected. The first player or team to collect the required amount wins the game.
- To use the **Score to End** setting, set the amount of score required to end the game. Then, set a score amount for each collectible item using the Collectible Object's Customize panel. The first team or player to reach the required score wins the game.

To find the Collectible Object device, press M to open the menu screen and select **Content**. From there you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use *italic* for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

By [default](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary), each collectible [object](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) will be visible to all players. When a player touches it, they gain a score of **1**, and the object disappears. The object is only hidden for players that have already picked it up. Other players will still see the collectible object and be able to pick it up.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.

If you choose **Specific Team Color** or **Specific Team Relationship**, the the **Specific Team Index** option displays below this one. |

## Direct Event Binding

**Direct event binding** allows devices to communicate directly, which makes your workflow more intuitive, and gives you more freedom to focus on your design ideas.

Below are the [functions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) and [events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) for this device.

### Functions

A [**function**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#function) listens for an event on a device then performs an action.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Turn Visibility On When Receiving From** | Makes the collectible object visible when an event occurs. |
| **Turn Visibility Off When Receiving From** | Makes the collectible object invisible when an event occurs. |
| **Respawn When Receiving From** | Respawns the collectible object when an event occurs. |
| **Respawn For All When Receiving From** | Respawns collectible object for all players when an event occurs. |

### Events

Direct event binding uses events as transmitters. An event tells another device to perform a function.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **On Collected Send Event To** | Sends an event to the selected device when a collectible object is picked up by a player. |
