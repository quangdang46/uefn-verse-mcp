An **ATK Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) an [ATK](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) golf cart into the level at the spawner's given location and orientation.

You can place a player directly inside the ATK using a trigger, or using functions and events.

  To find the **ATK Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

You can [customize device names](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) when using multiple copies of the same device.

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use *italic* for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
