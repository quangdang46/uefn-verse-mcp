# Barrier Device Design Examples

Find a few novel ways to apply this device to your own gameplay!

![Barrier Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dc48be6b-6a8a-489f-b3a7-d0ec6a044562?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

You can use Barrier devices to construct an impenetrable zone that blocks both player movement and weapon fire. Keep going to find a few novel ways to apply this device to your own gameplay!

## Make a Map Border

The **Barrier** device is often used to create an outer boundary around a play area. In this example, we’ll use the **Hollow Box** shape of the barrier to create an invisible wall to keep players contained.

### Devices Used

- 1 x [Barrier](http://using-barrier-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
- 1 x **Player Spawner** device

### Set Up the Devices

You now have the basic functionality for a contained play area using the Barrier device!

### Design Tip

The **Hollow Box** shape is a great way to set this up quickly, but sometimes, for more complicated maps, it can be helpful to use multiple overlapping barriers. This can give you more control over the shape of the area, how high it extends in different spots, and how the barrier looks in different sections.

## Build Protected Spawn Zones

You can set the Barrier device to block players from specific teams. In this example, you’ll set up a multiplayer island with protected spawn areas for each team.

### Devices Used

- 2 x Barrier devices
- 8 x Player Spawner devices
- 1 x Item Granter device
- 2 x Button devices
- 2 x Timer devices

### Set Up the Play Area

1. Create a basic play area using assets from the **Obstacle Course Gallery Black**. Populate the area with smaller pieces to create interesting hiding places and sight lines for players.
2. Create two spawn areas on either side of the play area, one red and one blue, using assets from **Obstacle Course Gallery Red** and **Obstacle Course Gallery Blue**.
3. Place four Player Spawner devices in the blue spawn area.
4. Customize each player spawner by adding a specific team to be spawned.
5. Place four more player spawners in the Red spawn area and update the Player Team for each to Team 2.
6. Place an Item Granter device outside of the play area. Register a Legendary Tactical Assault Rifle to the device.
7. Customize the Item Granter

To spruce up the gameplay, you’ll now give players the ability to “infiltrate” the enemy’s spawn zone!

1. Place a Button device to the left of the door leading into the red spawn area.
2. Customize the button.

   | Timer Running Text | Blue is Infiltrating the Red Spawn Area! |  |
5. Configure the following events on the button to allow the player pressing the button to pass through the barrier and start the timer.

7. Copy these two components and paste them in the same place next to the Blue spawn area.
8. On the button, update the **Activating Team** setting to **Team 2**.
9. On the timer, update the **Timer Running Text** to **Red is Infiltrating the Blue Spawn Area!**
10. On both devices, update **Direct Event Bindings** to ensure that the barrier being referenced is the **Team 1** barrier and not Team 2.

### Modify Island Settings

Make the following modifications to the island settings.

You now have the basic functionality for protected spawn zones with the ability for players to infiltrate!

### Design Tip

Even though a team can freely walk through the barrier in the door of their own spawn zone, note that they still cannot fire weapons through it. This is a good thing; it means that players can’t just sit in their spawn area and freely shoot out into the play area.

## Build a Melee Time Trial!

The Barrier device is useful for blocking off areas of the map until a player completes an objective.

In this example, you’ll use a barrier to prevent entry into a volcano lair until players manage to complete the climb within a set time limit!

### Devices Used

- 1 x Barrier
- 1 x Player Spawner
- 1 x Item Granter
- 6 x Creature Placer
- 2 x Button
- 1 x Timer
- 1 x Trigger
- 1 x Teleporter

### Bind Functions / Events

[Direct event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#directeventbinding) is how you set devices to communicate directly with other devices. This involves setting [functions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#function) and [events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#event) for the devices involved.

### Modify Island Settings

Make the following modifications to the island settings.

You now have a melee time trial island that uses the Barrier to create an unlockable area!

### Design Tip

The fact that we’re adding the successful player to the Barrier’s ignore list (rather than just disabling the Barrier) means that this functionality could be used easily in a multiplayer game where only players who have completed the objective should be able to access the area. Also, take a look through the different Barrier Materials. There are tons of cool options that can create really interesting effects!
