![Onboarding Sample Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7f2787f2-b2d2-4918-8c8a-b1fd41551294?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

You can play this sample using island code **9331-7614-5936**.

The Onboarding Sample offers developers an interactive, firsthand experience on the many devices that can be used to create basic levels. This is, overall, the best way to learn the [do’s and don’ts](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/introducing-players-to-your-new-fortnite-creative-island-and-map) for creating your own island.

Through this onboarding experience, developers will hop into the player’s shoes while learning key development concepts that can help make their island a great experience.

A major concept covered through this tutorial shows developers how to relay important information such as game rules and objectives to players. Players need to know the world around them and how to navigate through it to truly get the most out of any gameplay experience.

This makes communication one of the most important aspects of game design. The tips offered through this tutorial will set developers on their way to design game modes with clear rules and objectives that are easy to follow.

Developers will also learn other important ways to relay information to players. The devices covered in this Onboarding Island make for a gameplay experience that will bring players back for more.

The player will load into an introductory room that offers a general overview of the expected objectives. In this room, you will find a Player Spawn Pad which spawns a single player on the pad. For maps with multiple players, each player will need their own spawn pad, otherwise they will spawn in the sky and drop down from their parachute. You have the option to make Player Spawn Pads invisible and specify which teams can spawn from them.

On the wall, you will find a Billboard that offers customizable text to display informative messages to the player. You can alter the text size, justification, and viewing distance through the device options. Billboards with transparent borders will collide with the background and should be used cautiously.

[![Lock](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/02669b64-55eb-4d3e-9e12-6b326649f32a?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/02669b64-55eb-4d3e-9e12-6b326649f32a?resizing_type=fit)

*Lock Device*

The door to the next room will be unlocked by the Lock device located beside it. Walk through the door and enter the next room.

The next room also has instructional billboards that inform the player of the required objectives needed to advance into the next room. Billboards are an effective way to advance gameplay for players who are both unfamiliar with the game rules or need a simple reminder.

To unlock the door, the player must open a Chest to collect the items needed for the Conditional Button.

When changing walls and floors, be sure to detach any connected devices such as Conditional Buttons and Lock devices. Any device attached to a replaced tile will be deleted.
