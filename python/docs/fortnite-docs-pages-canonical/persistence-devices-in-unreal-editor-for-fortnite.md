# Persistence Devices

Using persistent data in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) provides a way for you to make game mechanics that persist across multiple game sessions. This is done by saving and uploading, then downloading saved data based on player statistics. This saved data can be applied to individual players when the player is online.

This means that a player who reaches a save point can leave the island, come back later and pick up where they left off with the same inventory, class and team level, and health stats, without having to restart the game from the beginning.

Islands with persistence tend to retain players more because the players have incentive to return to the island and continue progressing.

You can use persistence in progressional game modes like survival and tycoon. These types of game modes require players to accumulate items that satisfy long-term goals that drive gameplay.

Player data will not transfer from your Creative island to a UEFN project. If you revert your island back to its Creative state, your player data is retained, but you will lose any changes you made in UEFN.
