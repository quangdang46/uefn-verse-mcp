The wait is over, you can publish your Fortnite islands using The Walking Dead Universe (TWDU) assets, starting May 16 at 12 PM ET! Head to [Creator Portal](https://create.fortnite.com/welcome) to submit your island through content review.

The Walking Dead Universe (TWDU) will be featured front and center in **Discover**, with a dedicated **Game Collections** slot following the approach used for previous IP launches. Skybound, the IP holder, will curate a **TWDU Picks** row to highlight a varied selection of their favorite TWDU experiences. We’re continuing to experiment with and refine Game Collections to promote a wide range of high-effort islands that bring IPs to life.

TWDU islands are eligible for additional Discover placement, including Epic’s Picks — so don’t forget to [submit them](https://creative.fortnite.com/s/)! There will also be a quest for players to complete, encouraging players to explore TWDU islands.

We can’t wait to see what you’ve created!

## New Gunfight Template to Create High-Caliber FPS Games with UEFN

[![Gunfight Template in UEFN](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/98dbf1a6-5c41-4bf8-a493-6b962383fd55?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/98dbf1a6-5c41-4bf8-a493-6b962383fd55?resizing_type=fit)

Explore best practices for building engaging first-person shooter (FPS) gameplay with the new Gunfight 2v2 example template in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN).

This hands-on template offers a practical starting point for creating FPS islands using the [First-Person Camera](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-first-person-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative). It includes detailed Verse examples for player management, such as dynamic team balancing and weapon granting, all documented with inline notes.

You’ll also find guidance on efficient FPS game structure and level design, including how to build multiple distinct play areas within a single Fortnite island. Each round shifts the action to a different area, demonstrating how to create varied playspaces in one match.

Try out the playable version of the Gunfight template now (Code: 5043-2939-1074).
