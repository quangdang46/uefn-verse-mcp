# Making Custom Backplates

Create custom avatar backplates for your custom HUD.

![Making Custom Backplates](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/47f56452-6c9c-4518-84a7-1e3811f61208?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

Backplates display various types of information, such as a player’s avatar picture, gamer tag, health, shields, and more, on the HUD.

Backplates perform a number of functions, from helping identify teammates in multi-player cooperative games to identifying low health and shield stats.

In **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)**, backplates are made using materials or a mixture of textures and materials. Textures are used as containers that add a decorative flourish to the backplate, to add detail that a material can’t.

However, textures can be memory-intensive. This can add a strain on your memory budget and reduce the performance of your island. Textures and **Texture Sample** nodes in your material take up a large amount of memory.

Materials are best used to create flat designs, and can add animated effects to the backplate. Materials are less memory-intensive as they rely on the GPU to execute simple algebra math. This allows you to do a range of things, from creating simple shapes to animating complex interactions in a material.

When opting to use textures, be sure to use them sparingly — it is recommended that you avoid anything above 256 x 256 px for UI textures.

Materials are less memory-intensive because they use the GPU to render.

The method you use for your avatar backplates will depend on a number of factors:

- Personal preference for the UI design.
- UI style and design that complement the type of island experience you create
- How much memory you want to save

The avatar backplate design in this tutorial uses three **Material Instances** for the basic design. The following backplate designs were created using the **M_UI_Shape_Rectangle** material to include:

- A translucent pink background
- A pink container that surrounds the name text and the translucent background
- An aqua circle that will contain the player’s avatar

  [![A name plate is designed using 3 textures](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/82a7df89-55fc-4801-81c9-13c5efe58244?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/82a7df89-55fc-4801-81c9-13c5efe58244?resizing_type=fit)

  Create your own UI with materials! See [Creating Custom UI with Material Instances](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/creating-custom-ui-with-material-instances-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

## Set Up a Custom Widget

Use the [UI Pop-Ups](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/ui-popups-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) document’s **User Widget** workflow to:

The Widget Editor is where you’ll lay out the appearance and screen placement for your backplate design. Afterward, you’ll add a **Viewmodel** to create binding functionality to capture existing player information and bind it to the backplate design.

In the **Event Graph**:

1. Select the **Fill Screen** setting in the top-right corner and set it to **Desired** instead.

   Through this setting, you can change your widgets to a specified size so that your UI can appear seamless during gameplay.

   To layout the UI design for your custom HUD, you’ll begin by adding panels to the Event Graph.
2. In the **Palette** panel, navigate to the **Panel** section and drag a **Canvas** panel into either the **Event** or directly into the **Hierarchy** panel. Then, rename the panel **HUD_Canvas**.

   The **Canvas** **Panel** provides a way to anchor different UI elements to specific places on the screen. Make sure to have a UI design plan before adding more panels to the canvas to ensure your design layout is mirrored in the **Canvas Panel**.

   Only use the **Canvas panel** when you need to use specific UI elements as part of your design. For example, use this panel if you’re building a HUD and need to lay out different child widgets to specific places on the screen.

   Instead of changing the **Fill Screen** setting to **Desired,** you can resize the **Canvas Panel** to either **1920 X 1080** or **2560 X 1440**, which are the most common screen aspect ratios (16:9).
3. From the **Palette** panel's **Panel** section, nest a **Stack Box** under **HUD_Canvas** in the **Hierarchy** panel and rename it **Backplate_StackBox**. This is the container for the backplate UI, which will nest the widgets that make up your UI variables.

   As you add variables to the **Stack Box**, they’ll automatically stack left to right in the panel.

   You can also use the **Stack Box** to stack your UI elements from top to bottom.
4. From the **Palette** panel's **Common** section, nest an **Image** under **Backplate_StackBox**, and the **Hierarchy**. Then rename the **Image** to **Avatar_Image**, which will contain the avatar's border.
5. From the **Palette** panel's **Panel** section, nest an **Overlay** under **Backplate_StackBox** and rename it to **Nameplate_Overlay**. The **Overlay** provides a way for you to layer widgets on top of one another.

   [![Nest an Overlay under  Backplate_StackBox and rename to Nameplate_Overlay.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/072e7b75-e636-46e1-8cc0-8297d968b24f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/072e7b75-e636-46e1-8cc0-8297d968b24f?resizing_type=fit)
6. From the **Palette** panel, drag and nest two **Images** under **Nameplate_Overlay**.

   [![Nest two Images and two Text Blocks under Nameplate_Overlay. Rename the Text Blocks Active and Inactive.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c01d6fea-1503-45b4-bf32-d382c6bdd243?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c01d6fea-1503-45b4-bf32-d382c6bdd243?resizing_type=fit)

   Rename the images after the materials, **Background** and **Border**.
7. Drag and nest a **Size Box** panel under **Nameplate_Overlay**.

   Use the **Size Box** to set the properties of its nested children. This stops anything inside the **Size Box** from bleeding out and possibly covering other UI elements or gameplay.

   [![Nest a Size Box panel under Nameplate_Overlay.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3bb75578-884f-48bc-b5e1-aac7fa675536?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3bb75578-884f-48bc-b5e1-aac7fa675536?resizing_type=fit)
8. Drag and nest an **Overlay** under the **Size Box** and rename it **Text_Overlay**.

   Without an **Overlay**, you can only child one widget under the **Size Box**.

   [![Nest an Overlay under the Size Box and rename it Text_Overlay.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e099babe-517a-43ff-adf9-836e3fdcc570?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e099babe-517a-43ff-adf9-836e3fdcc570?resizing_type=fit)
9. From the **Palette** panel's **Common** section, drag and nest two **Text Blocks** under **Text_Overlay**. Rename the **Text Blocks** to **Active** and **Inactive**.

   [![Nest two Text Blocks under Text_Overlay.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/14712fa0-6d9c-49a3-a164-bb793064dfbd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/14712fa0-6d9c-49a3-a164-bb793064dfbd?resizing_type=fit)

The UI layout is complete. Next, you will set the widget's properties to make the size of the backplate UI elements relative to the screen size.

### Set Widget Properties

A container panel automatically adjusts its size to the largest widget inside it. The parent panel must contain all of its children before you begin editing its properties. Otherwise, the proportions of the parent element could shift as child UI elements are added in the **Hierarchy** tab.

Start setting the properties for the **Backplate_StackBox** panel to decide the screen placement and the boundaries of the backplate.

The following properties were edited for this backplate's design:

[![The Stack Box moves to the appropriate placement in the Event Graph to be closer to the anchor.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/21b1509c-0c8c-4392-bd8f-d8d346521d10?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/21b1509c-0c8c-4392-bd8f-d8d346521d10?resizing_type=fit)

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Anchors** | Bottom-Left Corner |
| **Alignment** | Should be set to a pair of coordinates that provide padding for your widget from the edges of the screen. |
| **Size to Content** | True |
| **Orientation** | Horizontal (All the child widgets will display left to right.) |
| **Shear X** | -20.0 (Skews the Stack Box negatively to the right.) |

Hold **Shift + Control** and click the bottom-left corner to automatically update the position and alignment of your widget.

The basic backplate layout pieces are in place. Now you’re ready to add the materials you created and edit the nameplate **Text Blocks**.

## Add and Edit Backplate Assets

The **Widget Editor** has settings for selected widgets to add materials and text as well as modify the asset properties used in the **Brush** setting.

It is important to note the material's arrangement order in the **Hierarchy** panel. When adding your assets, make sure they display properly. Background assets should be layered at the bottom with the additional assets layered on top.

### Edit Material Instances

Select your widgets in the **Hierarchy** panel to begin adding your materials and text.

The backplate takes on a basic look and now you’re ready to edit the **Text Blocks**.

### Edit the Nameplate

The nameplate displays the player's gamer tags. The backplate designed above contains both **Size Box** and **Text Blocks**.

By editing the **Size Box** properties you can prevent the text from extending outside of its boundary into other UI elements or obstructing the player's view.

The basic setup of the nameplate UI is complete. All the child elements take on the properties of their parent so the amount of editing you have to do to those widgets is minimal.

From the **Details** panel, you’ll edit the **Active** and **Inactive Text Blocks** by setting the alignment and font size, color, stroke, and much more.

Make sure the Active text is a separate color from the Inactive text. In this example, the Active Text Block font is a size of 145 in white with a Stroke of 6, and the Inactive font is a size of 145 in SlateGrey with a Stroke of 6.

![Active player name.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cfc4d4ce-df2c-459f-8652-24f92dd7ba15?resizing_type=fit&width=1920&height=1080)

![Inactive player name.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2a4698c7-90e1-4b78-ae64-57494f3f8ba2?resizing_type=fit&width=1920&height=1080)

Set the Inactive text box’s **Visibility** setting to **Hidden**. This prevents the text from displaying until the binding to the widget is triggered in-game.

[![Set the Inactive text box’s Visibility setting to Hidden.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2b631322-4fe2-47b9-b2d7-f9238061a4a8?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2b631322-4fe2-47b9-b2d7-f9238061a4a8?resizing_type=fit)

This pulls all the pieces together, the nameplate and the avatar backplate.

## Add View Bindings

Now that the UI design is built, it’s time to add bindings to the **Text Boxes** and **Avatar_Image** based on data they need to receive during a live session.

The **HUD Controller Player Info Viewmodel** provides a way to replace parts of your HUD with a custom widget. To take advantage of this setting, you need to create a Viewmodel of your backplate.

### Player Name Text

To get a player name to appear in the correct field, follow these steps:

1. Open the **View Bindings** tab by clicking **Window** > **View Bindings** or by selecting **View Bindings** on the bottom of the screen and docking it.

   [![View bindings tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7627c016-7121-42d1-9eea-498419e1144f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7627c016-7121-42d1-9eea-498419e1144f?resizing_type=fit)

   To see the **HUDPlayerInfoViewModelBase** list of view bindings:

   1. Open the **Viewmodels** window by selecting **Window** > **Viewmodels**.

   1. Go to **+Viewmodel** and select **HUD Controller Team/Squad Player Info Viewmodel Base**.

   The **HUD Controller Team/Squad Player Info Lis**t provides a way to show the Controlling Player’s information without their squad or team.

   1. Click **Select**.
