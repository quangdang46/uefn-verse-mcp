This feature is in Early Access. You can publish an island with this feature, but be aware that through the Early Access period, changes may break your island and may require your active intervention.

A title or intro sequence can add polish to your experience and convey information to your players. Sequences like these can provide backstory, set the mood, and even display who was involved in making the experience!

By completing this guide, you will learn how to create a title sequence that shows splash screens on a black screen with logos before transitioning to a title screen where the player can choose when to start the game. This example uses:

- [Fixed Point Camera](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-fixed-point-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices to set the different camera views, including the black background at the beginning.
- [HUD Message](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-hud-message-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices to show the logos and titles with a custom UI.
- [Pop-Up Dialog](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-popup-dialog-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices to handle the player UI selection to start the game.
- [Verse](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/programming-with-verse-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to manage the timing and transitions for camera views and UI elements.
