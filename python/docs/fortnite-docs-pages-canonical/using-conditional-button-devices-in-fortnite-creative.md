# Conditional Button Devices

Create a button that can only be activated when players are carrying specific items.

![Conditional Button Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ca3cb4d2-ac28-401c-aa68-5fd0a0e217ca?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

A **Conditional Button** is a [Button device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) that a player can only activate when carrying specific items. Unlike the regular Button device, the Conditional Button requires the player to possess a specific item or number of items to activate it. Without the specified item, the Conditional Button does not [trigger](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary).

To [register](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) an item to the Conditional Button, drop the item onto the device once the device has been [placed](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in *italic*.

All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

In its [default](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) state, the Conditional Button does nothing until you drop items onto the device to register them. You will also need to specify an event for the device that triggers another device's function when a player interacts with the button.

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.
