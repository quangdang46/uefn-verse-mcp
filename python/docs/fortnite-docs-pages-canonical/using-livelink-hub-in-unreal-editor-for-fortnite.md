# Using LiveLink Hub

Learn how to set up assets, connect to LiveLinkHub, and record motion capture data for use in-game.

![Using LiveLink Hub](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/07a00813-45e2-437d-b61a-f8dde3dbc40d?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

**LiveLink Hub** is a standalone executable that launches as a separate process on your workstation. Through LiveLink Hub, you can stream the data from your motion capture recording system to UEFN.

Use **LiveLink Hub** to capture data from your motion capture recording system to use as animations for your FN Mannequin characters, then use these animations to create movements that match your NPC's personality and theme.

You can then use the **[Take Recorder](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/BlueprintAPI/VirtualCamera/TakeRecorder?application_version=5.5)** to record the live animation captured in LiveLink Hub.

- 1Vicon Data Stream Source

### Subjects Panel

This holds animation subjects, which are individual characters or objects that are being streamed.

### Clients Panel

This panel displays the UE/UEFN sessions open on your computer or accessible on your network. By default, **LiveLink Hub** will automatically connect to and start streaming animation data to your UEFN session.

This tutorial will walk you through setting up your project to capture and record animations on a FN Mannequin character. These can then be used on a Fortnite character for the [**Character**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-character-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device.

You will first create an [**Inverse Kinematics (IK) Rig**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-ik-rig?application_version=5.4) from an imported skeletal mesh asset for FN Mannequin. IK Rigs are used for manipulating areas on skeletal meshes to create animations.

Then, stream your motion capture data into the **LiveLink Hub** to then record it to use in your gameplay and cinematics. **LiveLink Hub** is a tool that provides a common interface for streaming animation data into UEFN.

[![Island Templates](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5b7a190a-6c17-4cf9-a5c4-9b3f7c2994d7?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5b7a190a-6c17-4cf9-a5c4-9b3f7c2994d7?resizing_type=fit)

5. Make sure the **Skeleton** field is empty when importing the .fbx file, then select **Import All**.

   [![FBX Import](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ecbd3710-82c5-440d-a946-a3e0fa473c64?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ecbd3710-82c5-440d-a946-a3e0fa473c64?resizing_type=fit)
6. Take note of the assets created.

   [![Mocopi Assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7010a00f-d79a-4619-800a-4a6fc36547d3?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7010a00f-d79a-4619-800a-4a6fc36547d3?resizing_type=fit)
7. In the **Content Browser** locate your Mocopi assets and right-click on the "MocopiMannequin" skeletal mesh. Navigate to **Create** > **IK Rig**.

   [![Create IK Rig](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0cf04040-185d-43e3-957d-09bc0e548b96?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0cf04040-185d-43e3-957d-09bc0e548b96?resizing_type=fit)
8. Double-click on the new IK Rig asset "IK_Mocopi Mannequin" to open the asset window.

   [![New IK Rig](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0d89c085-10ec-4266-8616-0e9c08661e54?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0d89c085-10ec-4266-8616-0e9c08661e54?resizing_type=fit)
9. In the new window, click **Auto Create Retarget Chains**, then **Auto Create IK**, and save the asset.

   [![Auto IK](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ca4486da-9519-4be4-aa5a-105921034b52?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ca4486da-9519-4be4-aa5a-105921034b52?resizing_type=fit)

   The Mocopi skeleton will be the only asset recognized by UEFN.

[![Post Auto IK](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1cdc0bb2-294d-4f2c-9f7f-f095da6a40c6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1cdc0bb2-294d-4f2c-9f7f-f095da6a40c6?resizing_type=fit)

These two actions will create the FK Chains and IK Effectors needed for a full body solve.

You should now see the two sets of bones line up with each other. You can take this a step further by [retargeting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/ik-rig-animation-retargeting-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3) the source and target skeletons's base rotations.

Next, bring the live animation data into UEFN through LiveLinkHub.

## Streaming into LiveLinkHub

Follow the steps below to import your asset as an animation. This example uses a Sony mocopi motion capture system.

[![LiveLink Hub](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0022448a-cf61-4178-b9bd-051dec49170f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0022448a-cf61-4178-b9bd-051dec49170f?resizing_type=fit)

1. Navigate to **Tools** > **LiveLink Hub** to access the LiveLink Hub.
2. Add the mocopi source into LiveLink Hub by selecting **Add Source** < **Mocopi LiveLink** < **Create Mocopi Source**.
3. After the mocopi source has been added, you will see a new subject added in the **Subjects** panel. A green icon beside the subject indicates a healthy subject. A yellow icon indicates stale data that is not currently active.

   [![Mocopi Connected](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/60abb3af-1792-4fa2-a652-5b4869e9f36a?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/60abb3af-1792-4fa2-a652-5b4869e9f36a?resizing_type=fit)
4. In your UEFN session, drag the MocopiMannequin skeletal mesh into your level.
5. Next, add the FN_Mannequin to the next level.

   [![FN Mannequin](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1c8c6a6f-61f2-40b9-9a8d-39edbdb591bd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1c8c6a6f-61f2-40b9-9a8d-39edbdb591bd?resizing_type=fit)
6. Select the MocopiMannequin in the **Outliner** or **Viewport**.
7. In the **Details** panel, click **Add**, then type "Performer Component".

   [![FN Mannequin](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/93f3611e-866a-4516-b59d-d9880581d67e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/93f3611e-866a-4516-b59d-d9880581d67e?resizing_type=fit)
8. Select the new Performer Component. In the **Subject Name** field, select your MocopiSkeleton subject.

In the **Viewport**, you will now see your motion capture applied to the MocopiMannequin.

[![Moving Mocap](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4717adf0-26cb-4d51-a67c-3a03f92559ef?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4717adf0-26cb-4d51-a67c-3a03f92559ef?resizing_type=fit)

## Synchronizing Timecodes

In the steps below, you will set the UEFN timecode rate from LiveLinkHub. This will ensure your animations are recorded at the correct frame rate.

[![Green Time Code](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1d05a218-1efd-4fda-a165-52cafce9828d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1d05a218-1efd-4fda-a165-52cafce9828d?resizing_type=fit)

LiveLink will display the timecode as 30fps, the time, and a green icon to indicate that the timecode is being sent to UEFN.

## Recording Animation

In the steps below, you will capture an animation sequence on a FN Mannequin character to apply to a Fortnite character for the **Character** device.

Your recorded level sequence will now load for you to review.

[![Animation Sequence](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/542aca41-6905-4184-8ab7-774e0cb78f10?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/542aca41-6905-4184-8ab7-774e0cb78f10?resizing_type=fit)

Your character will continue to animate as if it has not been recorded. The end result will be an animation sequence on the Fortnite mannequin character, which you can apply to the Character device.
