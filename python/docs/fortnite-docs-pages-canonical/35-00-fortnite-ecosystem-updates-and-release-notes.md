![35.00 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/966abed5-7d00-4523-81e1-21e89d5794d4?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

V35.00 is here! General Physics is now available in UEFN as an Experimental feature, enabling dynamic, physics-based gameplay. This update also brings improved devices, new Burd and Nature Galleries, a new "Popular in Your Region" creator row in Discover, and much more.

## General Physics (Experimental)

[General Physics](https://create.fortnite.com/news/experimental-feature-general-physics-brings-enhanced-interactivity-to-fortnite-islands) enables physical interactions and simulations within Fortnite islands and is being released with v35.00 as Experimental. Physics must be explicitly opted into in Project Settings. Physics and provides creators with foundational physics functionality to create physics-based gameplay experiences. For a more in-depth look and beginner tutorials, check out the [Physics in UEFN](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/getting-started-with-physics) documentation.

- **Publishing**: Enabling Physics while it is experimental disables publishing. You can't publish your island while experimental features are enabled. If you disable Physics, your island will be publishable again.
- There is a **Physics** option in **Project Settings**, and setting it to **True** enables the following:

  - The **Player Spawner** device will spawn the player as a physics-based character.
  - Fortnite Props can have the new “Fort Physics” component added to enable, which enables physical simulation.
  - You can enable physics options and interactions on certain devices (see the Devices bullet below).
- **Interaction**: Players can interact with physics objects, for example:

  - **Moving** into the objects, including jumping into/onto them.
  - Striking the objects with the **Pickaxe**.
  - Using Fortnite “hitscan” weapons such as shotguns, pistols, assault rifles and SMGs on the objects.
- **Devices**:

  - Devices that have been updated for physics are in the **Fortnite > Devices > !Experimental** folder in your project.
  - All devices are available, but some may be incompatible with Physics.
- **Prop Mover**: Objects animated with the Prop Mover device will interact with physics objects.
- **Sequencer**: Objects animated with the Sequencer will not interact with physics objects.
- **Verse API**:

  - Added new Verse API to the **Volume** device:

    - PropEnterEvent
    - PropExitEvent
  - Patterns, naming and structure of Physics API might change to accommodate Scene Graph changes.
- **Player Movement Modes**: The physics-based character will have a limited set of player movement modes.
- **Weapons**: All weapons will be available, but only “hitscan” weapons will affect physics objects.
- **Items**: All items will be available, but some might not function correctly with the physics-based character.
- **Props**: All Fortnite props will be available.
- **Live Edit Known Issue**: There is a known issue where changing physics settings on a prop component requires pushing changes. This will be addressed in a future release.

## New Time of Day Manager for Fortnite Creative

Fortnite Creative has a new Time of Day Manager (TODM)! The upgrade guarantees:

- More realistic lighting with Lumen and Nanite.
- Parity with the UEFN TODM and future TODM updates.

With the upgrade to the new TODM comes the retirement of the **Skydome** device. All islands using the Skydome device will retain their gameplay, volume data, and positional data. However, the island lighting will default to Chapter 5 lighting, and will ignore any settings used with the Skydome device. New islands using the Skydome device will not be publishable.

To customize your lighting, use the [Day Sequence device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-day-sequence-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and the [Ambience settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/world-settings-in-fortnite-creative#ambience-settings) available in the **World Settings** category under **Island Settings**.

UEFN templates that are still using legacy lighting will be updated in the 35.10 release. Between 35.00 and 35.10, if you create a project using a UEFN template that has legacy TODM and a Skydome device, you will receive a prompt to convert to the new TODM.

To learn how to upgrade the lighting in the maps or how to replace the Skydome device, see the [Upgrading Legacy Lighting in Multi-Level Projects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/upgrading-legacy-lighting-in-multilevel-projects-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) document for more information.

## Matchmaking and Queues Documentation

Learn how to increase player satisfaction and player engagement by customizing matchmaking settings and queue controls. With the new queue controls, you can adjust matchmaking times and player targets to deliver the best-quality experience for your island. Learn how to take advantage of these new settings with the [Matchmaking and Queues](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/matchmaking-queue-controls-in-fortnite-creative) document.

## AFK In FNE

Players on any Creative or UEFN island will be automatically disconnected after 60 minutes of inactivity. A warning message will appear one minute before the player is disconnected, giving players a chance to stay in the session. Performing regular movements or interactions will reset the timer and prevent disconnection.

This is a temporary workaround while we work to resolve a bug related to AFK detection when a player is viewing video in full screen mode.

## UI Template Updates

### Material Assets

Learn more about **Signed Distance Field (SDF)** textures and how these can be used to upgrade your UI materials and the overall look of your UI. Signed Distance Field (SDF) is a function that uses position as an input, and outputs the distance from that position.

For example, in an SDF texture the center of the image is **1**, meaning fully white, but as it progresses towards the edge of the image, it transitions to **0**, fully black. Using this concept, SDFs provide a way to specify a range of values between 0 to 1 to apply an effect. Learn more about SDF textures, and how to use them in UI materials, in the [Material Assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/material-assets-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) document.

### Conversation Template Now Available in the UI Template

The Conversation template project can now be found inside the UI template. Future updates to the Conversation device feature examples will focus on how to improve and expand your conversation UI.

The Conversation template is still available in the Feature Examples section in the Project Browser.

## Creator Portal, Discover and Creator Rules Updates

### Fortnite Creator Rules Updates: Music Lyrics

It’s important that all island content aligns with Fortnite’s game ratings, including music lyrics.

We’ve added a new subrule (1.15.8) to our [Creator Rules](https://fn.gg/Creator-Rules), as a specific reminder that lyrics in your island must not exceed what your island's age rating allows. Also, now you’ll see this subrule referenced if you receive a music-related violation so you know where to address the issue.

Read our [IARC FAQ](https://fn.gg/IARC-FAQ) to learn about IARC and how to apply age ratings to your island.

### Thumbnail A/B Testing

The publishing and development process now has A/B testing for island thumbnails, to help you find the optimal thumbnail image for an island. This testing provides a way to compare the performative results of thumbnails to see which thumbnail had better engagement based on click-through rates. This helps you optimize engagement, use real player data to reduce guesswork, and iterate faster.

[![Thumbnail A/B testing in Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/84aca40d-eb64-4c77-956d-548ba6923cbf?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/84aca40d-eb64-4c77-956d-548ba6923cbf?resizing_type=fit)

### New Creator Row Now Available in Discover

Get more visibility to your Creator profile through the new dedicated Creator row added in Discover. The new **Popular Creators in Your Region** row automatically populates recommended creators based on a player's country, helping you grow your community.

## Content Browser and Inventory Updates

### Flashlights Now Work in First Person

We've added updated animations for flashlights in **First Person mode**, to ensure crouching does not break the action.

### Recently Used Content in the Creative Content Browser

You can now find the content or devices you’ve most recently used in the Home page of the Creative Content Browser to help you quickly get to the assets you use most often.

### Display Empty Ammo Slots

All inventory resources are now shown in players’ inventoriesy by default, so they can Request Ammo or Request Materials. The new **Display Empty Ammo Slots** island setting has been added so creators can show or hide ammo and materials when the player has none.

### Device Updates and Fixes

##### Updates:

- **Grind Rails**: Added a new user option for disabling grinding when a player is walking over the rail, and new user options to control grinding direction and minimum speed.
- **Bank Vault and Armored Transport**: Added new functions to destroy or restore the current active weak point.
- **Camera devices**: Added a new option to allow them to be used as **Elimination Cameras**. If this option is enabled, the selected camera will be used as the active camera as soon as a player is eliminated. This doesn't affect the camera while a player is spectating.
- The **Wildlife Spawner** and **NPC Spawner** devices now support Patrol Path usage on Wildlife and NPCs. New user options have been added to the two devices:

  - Spawn on Patrol Path Group
  - Enable Resuming Patrol Path
  - Change Patrol Path Target
  - Change Patrol Path Timer
  - Should Randomly Select Path
  - Can Assign to Disabled Paths
- The **Barrier** device has a new user option, **Can NPC Added To Ignore List**. This determines if NPCs can be added to the ignore list of the barrier. Once any NPC is added, all NPCs will be ignored by the device since they share the same navigation data.
- The **Movement Modifier** device has a new user option, **Apply To Non-Player Character**. This option supports usage with Guards, NPCs and Wildlife. The default value is **Off**. When this option is set to **On**, AI characters can be affected by the device.
- Shoe Cosmetics are now supported on both the **Player Reference** device and **Dance Mannequin** device.

##### Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where the Timer device would not synchronize for users joining in progress.
- Fixed an issue where having two or more Prop Manipulator devices on the same prop would result in the one with the highest priority not being selected.
- Fixed an issue where the Accolade device's Award UI wouldn't appear after placing it while in Edit mode.
- Fixed an issue where the Matchmaking Portal device displayed a default texture on half of one side.
- Fixed an issue where the Target Dummy's preview box was too large when placing the device.
- Fixed an issue where the Accolade device failed to display text on the UI in subsequent rounds on published islands.
- Fixed an issue where the Day Sequence device **Enabled During Phase** option was not being disabled properly when entering the island, when the option was set to any value other than **All phases**.
- Fixed an issue with the Patchwork Music Manager's **Tempo** user option, where fractional tempo values set from UEFN or the Creative Customize panel were rounded off.
