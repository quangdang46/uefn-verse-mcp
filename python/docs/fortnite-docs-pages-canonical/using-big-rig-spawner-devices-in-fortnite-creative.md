# Big Rig Spawner Devices

Place a semi truck vehicle in your game for your players to drive.

A **Big Rig Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) a semi truck onto an island at the spawner's given location and orientation.

Use Big Rig Spawner devices in combination with [Race Checkpoint devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) to design a racing game worthy of open freeways.

Place a player directly inside the Mudflap at any point in the game using a [Trigger device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

**Looking for a fun idea?** See **[Big Rig Device Design Example](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/big-rig-device-design-example-in-fortnite-creative)** to jumpstart your imagination!

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

  To find the **Big Rig Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).  Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use *italic* for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.
