![Sentry Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cd0406a6-27eb-4ace-b492-ba37aed9fd66?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Sentry** device spawns an [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) bot that usually attacks players when they come in range. As a device, you can place sentries anywhere.
To find the Sentry device, go to the Creative inventory and select the Devices tab. From there you can search or browse for the device. For more information on finding devices see [Finding and Placing Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. You can choose names that relate to each device's purpose, so it's easier to remember what each one does.
##  Device Options
Basic options include setting the sentry health and what weapons you want to arm a sentry with.
###  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in _italic_.
All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
You can configure this device with the following options.

##  Design Examples
Here are some examples of how you can use the Sentry device.
  * [Ambush Sentry](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-sentry-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
  * [Guard Sentry](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-sentry-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
  * [Upgradeable Sentry](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-sentry-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

###  Ambush Sentry
You can use sentries with a lot of customizability to create traps with various resolutions beyond simply shooting them down. In this example, the player must flip a switch to deactivate the sentries.
You will need the following devices.
  * 2 x **Sentry** device
  * 1 x [Trigger](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
  * 1 x [Switch](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-switch-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device

  1. Create a simple enclosed area. In two locations, place a Sentry device customized to the following settings.
[![Sentry Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/476ea22f-0d98-4145-af7b-ed5aff316f47?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/476ea22f-0d98-4145-af7b-ed5aff316f47?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description

**Weapon Type** |  Assault Rifle |  The weapon used by the sentry.
**Health** |  1000 |  The health of the sentry. Makes it nearly indestructible.
**Shield** |  1000 |  The shield of the sentry. Makes it nearly indestructible.

**Target Style** |  Proximity |  Targets are selected regardless of LOS, allowing more consistent behavior in open areas.
**Spawn On Game Start** |  No |  The sentry will not spawn until the device receives a signal from a channel.
**Spawn When Receiving From** |  Channel 1 |  When the device receives a signal on Channel 1 from the Trigger, the sentries spawn to attack the player.
**Pacify When Receiving From** |  Channel 2 |  When the device receives a signal on Channel 2 from the player flipping the switch, the sentries stop attacking.
  2. Place a switch somewhere nearby that will pacify the sentries, and customize it to the following settings. This is an aesthetic choice, and a button will work just as well.
[![Ambush Button](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1f601caf-5207-49a8-b3c3-1efb3e01755b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1f601caf-5207-49a8-b3c3-1efb3e01755b?resizing_type=fit)

**When Turned On Transmit On** |  Channel 2 |  After 3 seconds, transmits a signal to pacify all the sentries and make them stop attacking.

**Visible in Game** |  No |  The Trigger device is not visible during gameplay.
**When Triggered Transmit On** |  Channel 1 |  When the trigger is activated, both sentries start attacking until the switch is activated.
You now have the basic setup for a Sentry trap.
You can make the sentries destroyable instead, if you prefer them to not be deactivated with a button. They could also be set across a maze, creating a suddenly dangerous environment to navigate through once more. Their weapons, accuracy, and radius can all be fine tuned to get the level of threat you desire for your sentries.
###  Guard Sentry
In this example, you can set up sentries players can use akin to defensive turrets, that will attack enemies not on their team, even wildlife. Follow these instructions to set it up.

  3. Place a Button device near the platform which a player can use to activate the sentries. Customize it to the following settings.
[![Guard Button](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b81ccfc2-e4b8-4439-ac7a-693a12cc75dc?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b81ccfc2-e4b8-4439-ac7a-693a12cc75dc?resizing_type=fit)

**When Completed Transmit On** |  Channel 2 |  After finishing the 10 second default countdown, sends a signal to despawn the sentries and allow them to be spawned again.
You now have the basic functionality to temporarily spawn defensive sentries.
This design mentions a number of features that can be included into this. For example, you can adjust the time the sentries are available, and trigger them using a Signal Remote or with much longer delays for more tactical cooldowns. These can be restricted to certain classes, in PvP style gameplays, or allow a chaos element in a free-for-all where anyone can trigger them, or have them trigger when a player has an elimination streak.
