![World Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dd4d1203-7e70-45bf-af5a-7bd31192a931?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

Your island is a **world** where you can set the rules for friendly AI behavior, vehicles, harvesting, and lighting (ambiance). The settings on this category control how players interact with your world.

There are several World subcategories, and most of them have multiple settings. From the Island Settings tab, click **World**, then click any **subcategory** to expand it.

[![Find the World category under Island Settings.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/91247eb5-6e1e-4f47-aa08-4424e27955d5?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/91247eb5-6e1e-4f47-aa08-4424e27955d5?resizing_type=fit)

If you know the name of a setting you want to change, use the **search bar** to find it.

Any changes you make to these settings are automatically saved. You can restore the settings to their original values at any time by clicking the **Restore Defaults** button. This will reset only the settings for your current category.

The following sections describe the settings available in each subcategory, and how you can use them.

Some settings are grayed out. This usually indicates that another setting must be changed to make that setting available.

Default values are **bold**. Values that make other settings active or inactive are *italic*.

## Friendly AI Settings

An **AI** (short for artificial intelligence), is a programmed [non-player character](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#npc). An AI can be an opponent, but in some cases, can also be an ally. When an AI is on your side, it's a **friendly AI**.
