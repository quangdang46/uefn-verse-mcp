![Gold Items](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c0776082-c931-444b-86bf-ab1abe83367e?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
You can [register](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#register) **Gold** items as required [currency](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#currency) for players to use on your island. The set requirements will show on a HUD message near the device.
You can use this item as required currency for devices like:
  * **Conditional Button**
  * **Item Spawner**
  * **Vending Machine**

While [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game), you can offer gold throughout the world for players to collect by through devices like the **Item Spawner** or **Item Granter**.
Through the [My Island - Settings menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), you can adjust multiple settings for gold allocation on your island. You can change settings like **Show Gold Resource Count** to determine if gold will show on the player's HUD.

##  Finding and Placing Items
[![Finding Gold Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b73543c3-3fb9-4691-88b6-b11984ef6668?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b73543c3-3fb9-4691-88b6-b11984ef6668?resizing_type=fit)
_Click image to enlarge._
  1. From **Create mode** , press the **Tab** key and click **CREATIVE** to select the **Creative inventory screen**.
  2. Click the **CONSUMABLES** tab.
  3. On this screen, scroll to find and select the item, use the **Search** box to look up the item by name, or check the list of relevant **Categories** specific to the item you’re looking for to filter the view.
  4. Click the item, then click either **EQUIP** or **ADD TO CHEST**.

Clicking **EQUIP** will add the item to your [Resources bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#resources-bar). (When you're back in Create mode, you can view items in your Resources bar by pressing the **Tab** key and selecting **Play**)
You may want to offer an item bundle to players through a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#chest) or [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama). Selecting **ADD TO CHEST** will add the item to the [CHEST tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
[![Adding Gold to Chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ecb61c56-30ac-4ff4-ab29-476175a1a8b4?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ecb61c56-30ac-4ff4-ab29-476175a1a8b4?resizing_type=fit)
_Click image to enlarge._
Each time you click **ADD TO CHEST** , the item count will increase by one, shown in a yellow box on the **CHEST** tab.
You can add up to fifteen items to the **CHEST** tab. When it’s full, the **ADD TO CHEST** tab will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the **CHEST** tab.
From the **CHEST** tab, you can select either **CREATE CHEST** or **CREATE LLAMA** to store the items in a Chest or a Llama for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game).
##  Managing Items
You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-inventory). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. In the Play inventory screen, you can create or split item stacks, or remove them entirely from the Resources bar.
[![Crafting Items Resources Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0149cdcd-14b9-4d5f-97f8-7d12be277d9f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0149cdcd-14b9-4d5f-97f8-7d12be277d9f?resizing_type=fit)

Instead of dropping these items on the ground, it's best to grant them to players by using item-granting devices like the Item Spawner.
You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either _Respawn_ or _Back To Hub_ from the _Menu_. When you do this, your inventory clears.
##  Registering Items
Some devices can hold or grant items. To [register](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#register) an item for this kind of device, follow these steps.
  1. In CREATIVE inventory, find the equipment and items you want to register with a device and equip them.
  2. In Create mode, stand directly beside the device that will register the item.
  3. Press the **Tab** key to open the **PLAY inventory** screen.
  4. Click the item, then press either **Z** or **X** to split or drop the item. You can also drag the item to the side until a [backpack icon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#backpack-icon) appears.

The compatible device will automatically register the dropped item.
