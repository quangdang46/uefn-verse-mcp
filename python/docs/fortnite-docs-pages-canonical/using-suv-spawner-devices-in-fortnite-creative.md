# SUV Spawner Devices

Spawn a rugged SUV on your island.

![SUV Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e4ce5af0-2aa7-4b92-9fcc-c1dde4ade843?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The **SUV Spawner** spawns a rugged and stylish sport utility vehicle (SUV) that players can use to [traverse](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#traverse) your island – whether they are driving around town, need protection while moving to an objective, or are in an off-road race.

For help on how to find the SUV Spawner device, see [**Using Devices**](using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in *italic*.

All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.
