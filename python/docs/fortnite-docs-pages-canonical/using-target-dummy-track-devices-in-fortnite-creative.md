The **Target Dummy Track** is a customizable moving target that players can use to practice shooting [ranged weapons](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#ranged-weapon). It has a variety of target types, and you can customize the target's behavior in many ways:

- The target can move along the track at varying speeds.
- The target can stand up or knock itself down on a timer.
- The target can stand up or knock itself down randomly.
- The target can hop up from its standing position, or hop up and drop down randomly.

If you are looking for stationary targets, see [**Target Dummy**](using-target-dummy-devices-in-fortnite-creative). Combine multiple copies of the Target Dummy and Target Dummy Track devices to create fun minigames for your players!

For help on how to find the **Target Dummy Track** device, see [**Using Devices**](using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#rename-a-device) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [**Event Browser**](event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in *italic*.

All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.
