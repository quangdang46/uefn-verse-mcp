# Post Process Device Design Examples

Set a specific mood on your island with the Post Process device.

![Post Process Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/65121d93-9bab-4894-a03a-ec3aaae739cb?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

While the [World Island Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/world-settings-in-fortnite-creative) provides many of the camera filters found here, the **Post Process** device offers even more options and ways to apply them.

You can apply these effects to the whole island or a specific player, or control the effect based on interactions with players, other devices, or by time.

Make sure the **Camera Filter** setting on the [World](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/world-settings-in-fortnite-creative) tab is set to **Default (none)** before using this device.

## Basic Post Processing

The Post Process device is great for giving your game a unique visual feel. In this example, you’ll learn how to create an island with a spooky aesthetic inside a building!

### Design Tip

Right out of the box, the Post Process device can change the feel of your island. Consider the combination of processing effects and buildings you use. If you’re using an old-timey processing effect, try pairing it with a Wild West environment!

## Speed Screen Effect

You can set post processing effects to be temporary, and to blend in and out over time. In this example, you’ll use this functionality to create a screen effect for when the player gets a speed boost!

   | --- | --- | --- |
   | On Activation Send Event To | Post Process Device | Blend in for All |
9. Duplicate this Movement Modulator and place it in another location.

### Configure the Timer

You now have the basic functionality for a speed boost screen effect.

### Design Tip

You can also use other Post Process effects to create immersion in specific gameplay moments. For example, try using the **Rain** effect with the **Water** device to make a screen effect when the player interacts with the water!

As you’ll see in the next example, the Post Process device is also great for stealth games!

## Build a Nighttime Heist Game!

The Post Process device has great settings for gameplay moments like sneaking around at night with night vision goggles, or looking through CCTV cameras!

### Bind Functions / Events

[Direct event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#directeventbinding) is how you set devices to communicate directly with other devices. This involves setting [functions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#function) and [events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#event) for the devices involved.

### Modify Island Settings

Make the following modifications to the island settings.

You now have a stealth game in which the player can view a vault through CCTV cameras!

### Design Tip

The use of priorities with multiple Post Process devices can give very complex and fine-tuned processing behavior.

Using more devices with set priorities, you can create different gameplay moments that trigger unique post processing changes without having to turn all of the different devices on and off — all you have to do is enable and disable the device with the highest priority! Place another Post Process device.
