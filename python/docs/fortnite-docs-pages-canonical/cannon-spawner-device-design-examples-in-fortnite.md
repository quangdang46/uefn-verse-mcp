# Wildlife Spawner Devices
Populate your island with animals — some nice and some not so nice — that you can herd, hunt, tame or dodge!
![Wildlife Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e475c9c9-4e19-467a-a308-b7c5bfd5f020?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Wildlife Spawner** device can be customized to [spawn](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) various animals.
Animals you can spawn using this device include:
  * Sky Jelly
  * Wildwasps
  * Spring Chicken (Prey)
  * Chicken (Prey)
  * Frog
  * Boar (Prey)
  * Wolf (Predator)
  * Raptor (Predator)
  * Air Sprite
  * Water Sprite
  * Dash Sprite

Players can hunt for the prey animals (chickens and boars), which will drop resources (such as meat) when they are eliminated. Some animals spawned by this device can be tamed and ridden by players:
  * Boars
  * Wolves
  * Raptors

To tame an animal, you can just jump on its back when it is near you. Once an animal is tamed, it will follow the player at a distance and can be used as a mount. Some will attack other players and animals that are hostile to the player that tamed them. Players can tame up to three animals at a time. The **Raptor** can also jump while being ridden, and have a very high jump height. This can be used with the environmental design on your island to introduce traversal puzzles, secret areas or loot, and other variations in gameplay and movement.
You can also select a different appearance for some animals, to match the biome of your island. Animals that have biome variants include:
  * Chicken
  * Boar
  * Wolf
  * Sprites

Use the **Biome Variant** option to change the appearance of the animals spawned. Choices are listed in the Device Options section, below.
While there isn't a limit on the number of Wildlife Spawners you can have on an island, there is a limit on the total number of spawned AI enemies on an island. This includes creatures, guards, and wildlife. You can only have 90 AI enemies active at a time, across all devices that spawn AI enemies. If you have a lot of Wildlife Spawners, or if you also have Guard or Creature Spawners on your island, keep track of the number of enemies each is spawning so you stay under the overall limit.
For help on how to find the **Wildlife Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate. However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering.
To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the **Description** field for that option.
##  Device Options
This device has some basic functionality, like choosing the type of animal, choosing the biome variant, and how many animals spawn. There are also advanced options, like setting the total number of animals spawned, and how much health each animal has.
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.

**Enable Resuming Patrol Path** |  **On** , Off |  Determines if the wildlife should resume patrolling their path if it was disabled and then enabled. If set to **Off** , the wildlife must be assigned a path through a path's "Assign AI To Path" function to continue path following.

If set to Off, the device will select the path in order of their indexes if they have been set, or on the path that has not had Wildlife spawned on it, which resets after a Wildlife has spawned on each Patrol Path in the Patrol Group. If multiple paths have the same index they will be randomly ordered between themselves.
