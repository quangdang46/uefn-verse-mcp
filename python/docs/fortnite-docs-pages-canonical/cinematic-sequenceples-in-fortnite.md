See several ways you can make use of engaging in-game cutscenes for your island.

![Cinematic Sequence Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f19c2523-0aaf-4089-a226-909ceec9a349?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

Available in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) only**, this device is perfect for creating [cutscenes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#cutscene) for player onboarding, in-game instructions, or just for fun!

## Starting Weapon Sequence

The **Cinematic Sequence** device has settings that you can use to create a basic opening sequence to give the player their starting weapons one by one instead of all at once!

### Devices Used

- 1 x [Cinematic Sequence](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-cinematic-sequence-device-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) device
- 1 x [Player Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
- 1 x [Item Granter](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device

### Set Up the Devices

1. Place a **Player Spawner** device.
2. Place an **Item Granter** device.
3. Customize the Item Granter as follows:

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c7959e60-d3dc-4d9d-8f19-50f61768a4cd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c7959e60-d3dc-4d9d-8f19-50f61768a4cd?resizing_type=fit)

   | Option | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | On Grant Action | Keep All |
   | Item List - Index [0] - Item Definition | Tactical Assault Rifle L1 |
   | Item List - Index [1] - Item Definition | Tactical Pistol L1 |
   | Item List - Index [2] - Item Definition | Grenade |
   | Receiving Players | All |
4. Create a [level sequence](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/r4jn/fortnite-uefn-using-level-sequencer) called **StartingWeaponsSequence**.
5. Place a **Cinematic Sequence** device.
6. Customize the Cinematic Sequence device as follows:

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f0eea0a7-687c-4c8a-9486-006b7312a50a?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f0eea0a7-687c-4c8a-9486-006b7312a50a?resizing_type=fit)

   | Option | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Sequence | StartingWeaponSequence |
   | Auto Play | Yes |
7. Open the **StartingWeaponSequence** and add the Item Granter to the timeline. Create three [keyframes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#keyframe) for gameplay events. The first will **Grant Item** and the next two will call **Cycle to Next Item**.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1ddee787-279e-4f88-9643-834083278619?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1ddee787-279e-4f88-9643-834083278619?resizing_type=fit)

You now have the basic functionality for an opening weapon sequence!

### Design Tip

Simple effects like this are a great way to give your game a more polished, cinematic quality. Making gameplay changes sequential instead of all at once can also give the player a chance to process what’s happening during the game. In this example, players see each weapon separately for a better starting understanding of their loadout!

## Survival Platforming Minigame

You can use the Cinematic Sequence device to trigger different sequential events with different devices.

In this example, you’ll create a simple platforming mechanic with beacons to indicate where the player should jump.

- 1 x Player Spawner device
- 1 x [Damage Volume](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-damage-volume-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
- 16 x [Prop Manipulator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-prop-manipulator-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices

    [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/41e5a91a-8b49-434f-accf-f50acd26015d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/41e5a91a-8b49-434f-accf-f50acd26015d?resizing_type=fit)

    | Loop Playback | True |
    | Auto Play | True |
12. Follow the pattern of **Gameplay Event** **keyframes** below, with each of the Beacons in order.

    For the first beacon, **Disable** it on the first frame and Enable again at 60 frames before the sequence loops. For all of the other Beacons, Enable on the first keyframe, then Disable 60 frames later.

    [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/24192c46-cbf1-4f64-b86b-0e50515d1aa8?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/24192c46-cbf1-4f64-b86b-0e50515d1aa8?resizing_type=fit)
13. Follow a similar pattern for all of the Prop Manipulators in order, this time with the first Prop Manipulator calling Show Props on the first frame and Hide Props 60 frames later.

    [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5c692ad3-0931-446e-ad8e-a83365859f44?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5c692ad3-0931-446e-ad8e-a83365859f44?resizing_type=fit)

You now have the basic functionality for a survival platforming minigame!

### Design Tip

The Cinematic Sequence device is great for this kind of timed gameplay. Keyframes can be copy/pasted easily on the timeline, so you can quickly get sequential repeating behavior on different devices like this!

### Configure the Rhythm Mechanics

### Modify Island Settings

Make the following modifications to the island settings object.

- Under **Round**, change **Stat** ****Value** to **End**** to **Score**, then change **Stat Value to End** to **10**.

  [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e3140f2d-5a19-4b26-ae80-0003b233a3e1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e3140f2d-5a19-4b26-ae80-0003b233a3e1?resizing_type=fit)

You now have a basic rhythm game!

### Design Tip

This example uses a very simple repeating pattern to show the basics of rhythm mechanics with the Cinematic Sequence device, but you can use the timeline to create much more complicated compositions! Explore using different objects to represent different types of notes, with an  indication of which notes will be coming next!
