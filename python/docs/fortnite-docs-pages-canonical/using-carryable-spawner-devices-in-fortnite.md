# Carryable Spawner Devices

Use the Carryable device to give players objects they can throw at other players.

The **Carryable Spawner** device can spawn carryable objects on your island. These carryable items can be picked up, carried, dropped, and thrown by players.

Carried items spawned by this device are clearly visible to other players (since they are carried above the head), and restrict the carrying player's movement. You can even set the carried item to explode on impact with a character, or when it collides with another object!

If you are using this device in UEFN, you can customize the mesh, the sound effect for the explosion, and the VFX for the explosion.

For help on how to find the **Carryable Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the **[Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative)**.

## Using the Device

To use the Carryable Spawner device, follow this workflow.

1. Determine where you want to spawn the carryable object, and place the device.
2. Choose what object to spawn (if you are using custom meshes in UEFN).
3. Customize the options for spawning and respawning the object.
4. Customize the options that determine how players interact with the object, such as when it is dropped or whether players can jump while holding the object.
5. Customize the options for whether the carryable object can damage structures and world objects in the environment.
6. Customize the SFX and VFX (if you are using UEFN).
7. Start the game to playtest.

## Contextual Filtering in Creative

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in *italic*.

All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the Description field for that option.

## Options

This section details the device options (in Creative) or user options (in UEFN).

- To customize options in Creative, approach a device and press **E** to open the **Customize** panel.
- To customize options in UEFN, select the device in your viewport or in the Outliner. Options for this device are found in the **Details** panel, in the **User Options** section.

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.
