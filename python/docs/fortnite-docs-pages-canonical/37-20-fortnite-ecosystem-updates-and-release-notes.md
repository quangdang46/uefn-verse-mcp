# 37.20 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes

Find out what's new with the 37.20 release of Fortnite on September 10, 2025!

![37.20 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6416b545-1794-4098-a329-c419592a016a?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

Fortnite v37.20 introduces the Roly Poly Spawner device, the Hive Stash Chest, and new prefabs and galleries from the O.X.R. Base and The Hive. This update also adds three new Debug Command menu options, new tutorials, and the ability to subscribe to input action events and mapping contexts directly through Verse.

## New Experimental Character Inputs!

You can now subscribe to input action events and mapping contexts directly through Verse. The following character input actions are supported:

- Jump
- Crouch
- Shoot (Weapon Primary)
- Target (Weapon Secondary)
- Sprint

The inputs are currently Experimental, but over time, more functionality will be added to this list of input actions. We want to provide a clean and clear way to use the various controls available in UEFN.

## My First Island Feature Example!

Get started in My First Island with this new feature example! See how the carnival shooting gallery was set up, including the custom Verse device code to earn points for shooting the good targets, and detracting points for shooting the bad targets — –who wants to hit a cute bear?

This template showcases the full gameplay example set up in the [Build Your First Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/build-your-first-island-in-fortnite) documentation tutorial series, and even adds a little more, using a HUD Message device to show the player score.

## Deprecation of Creative Custom Input Keybinds

After some consideration, we have decided to deprecate custom Creative keybindings. While the names for these keybinds referenced associated Fortnite actions (like Shoot or Aim), they were referencing the default keybinds for those actions. So if a player changed their "fire" keybind to something that wasn't the default, the Creative keybind would not change, which was by design.

This has created  problems for developers because they don't have a way to "guarantee" an action is lined up to the expectation. This has also created a problem for players, as a creator might say "use your shoot button to do x" but because the player changed their shoot keybind, and the creator is using creative input 1 (shoot), the player is expecting their new shoot keybind, and will be confused about why it doesn't work.

Going forward, we are removing  the Creative Custom inputs from the Settings menu, but not from the Input Trigger device. For creators, there should functionally be no difference.  For players, there could potentially be a difference if they had rebound any of the Creative Custom Input keybinds.

This change will currently only affect:

- Fire
- Target
- Crouch
- Jump
- Sprint

## Advanced Learning: New Coordinate Battle Island and Tutorial!

Deep dive into mathematics to level up your gameplay and get deeper insights into modern game design practices!

With the [Coordinate Battle Tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/coordinate-battle-tutorial), you can learn how some of the ways coordinates in two- and three-dimensional spaces affect gameplay, and learn how to build a two-person battle based on guessing coordinates as you go!

The island code for the Coordinate Battle game will be coming soon! Stay tuned!

## Get Started with Verse: New Combo System Tutorial!

This beginner Verse tutorial uses the Your First Island template to show off how Verse can really level up your island! In this tutorial you will:

- Build a point combo system for the shooting gallery.
- Add timer and bonus timer systems.
- Level up your weapons as you progress.
- Learn about refactoring code, an integral part of iterative programming and design.

To start the tutorial, you can open the My First Island project and jump right into the [Your First Island: Level Up with Verse](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/your-first-island-level-up-with-verse-in-fortnite)!

## New Debug Commands

We are committed to improving your efficiency in debugging using the Beta Debug Command menu with frequent releases of new debug commands. This release we are adding:

- Pause Round Timer - Pause or resume the island round timer.
- End Round - Force the current round to end.
- End Game  - Force the current game to end.

## New Roly Poly Spawner Device

The Roly Poly is a bug that wraps around the player for creative gameplay where both player and bug bounce and roll around the map. Use the device to spawn a customizable Roly Poly in your Creative games.

Learn more about using the Roly Poly device on your island with the [Roly Poly Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-roly-poly-devices-in-fortnite) page.

### Physics Experimental Known Issues

- Player sprinting is accelerating slowly. This causes foot sliding as the character does not accelerate as it should. This will be addressed in a near future release.

- Skydive Volume: Push Forces above 0 will not push the player to the top of the volume.
