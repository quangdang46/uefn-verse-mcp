The **Ascender** device is a fast-moving cable mechanism that players can use to travel up or down. You can use it to:

- Provide players with a fast and exciting method of vertical travel.
- Make difficult terrain easier to traverse, particularly on islands that don't allow building.
- Give players a fast way to reach the high ground.
- Give players more tactical choices for gaining advantage over enemies.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate. However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use *italic* for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.

You can configure this device with the following options.

| Option | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Enabled During Phase** | None, **Always**, Pre-Game Only, Gameplay Only, Create Only | Determines the phases in which the device is enabled. **Pre-Game Only** refers to any phases that occur before the game starts. |
| **Ascender Style** | **Ground**, *Wall*, Cable Only | Determines what the Ascender looks like and how it holds the cable. If you select **Wall**, an additional option displays below this one. |
| **Arm Extension Length** | **0**, Pick or enter a number | This option only displays if you select **Wall** for the **Ascender Style** option. This determines the length of the wall-mounted arm that holds the cable. Choose a number between **0** and **160**. |
| **Max Cable Length** | **70**, Pick or enter a number | This determines the length of the ascender cable. Pick a number between **3** and **1000**. |
