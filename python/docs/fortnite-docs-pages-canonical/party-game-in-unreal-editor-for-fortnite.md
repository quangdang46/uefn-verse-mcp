A Party Game is a collection of mini-games accessible from a central hub. This tutorial features important steps to creating key gameplay elements for your own party game by:

- Adding devices to a [**pre-game lobby**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/building-pre-game-lobbies-in-fortnite-creative) to make a voting HUB and create a simple voting structure.
- Changing the typical camera view with a [**Fixed Point Camera**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-fixed-point-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to create a unique gameplay view.
- Using [**Sequencer’s**](unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#sequencer) [Gameplay Events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/gameplay-events-in-sequencer-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) feature to drive the game mechanic in a mini-game.
- Scripting a [Reusable Game Manager](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/party-game-4-reusable-game-manager-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) in Verse to use with all your mini-games.

Up to **8** players can join a Party Game play session. Mini-games in this tutorial have a max capacity of 4 players, and each game takes roughly 1 and a half minutes to play.
