### Modify Island Settings

Make the following modifications to the island settings.

### Design Tip

As this example shows, there are different ways to compare stats with the Stat Counter device. You can check whether a stat is lower, higher, equal to, or not equal to another stat, so experiment with ways to create custom stat mechanics.

## Build a Crafting Level System

The Stat Counter can be used to track levels of a given stat, allowing you to configure different unlocks for different levels. In this example, you’ll create a crafting level system that will unlock new crafting recipes as players harvest more material!
