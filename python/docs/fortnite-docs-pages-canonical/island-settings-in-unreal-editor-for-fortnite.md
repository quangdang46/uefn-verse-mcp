# Island Settings in UEFN

See how to modify Island Settings in UEFN.

![Island Settings in UEFN](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5d5eb8f6-523b-40b8-8f7c-e434a57dac27?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

**Island Settings** provides a way to control factors as varied as how many players can play at the same time to the time of day on your island.

Every island in UEFN includes a utility for Island Settings, and for the most part, these settings are the same ones you can find in **Fortnite Creative**. The presentation, however, is different.

Where Island Settings in UEFN differ from those in Creative, this is called out below.

## Access Island Settings

To access the Island Settings in UEFN, go to **Outliner** and type **island settings** in the search box.

Highlight the first instance, and the information will appear in the **Details** panel. (If the Details panel isn't already open, go to the menu bar at the top of the viewport, click Window, then Details, then select a Details panel.)

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8ce9f972-7b20-4b0e-84d7-dc47de755fd2?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8ce9f972-7b20-4b0e-84d7-dc47de755fd2?resizing_type=fit)

If you can't find the Islands Settings in the Outliner, go to the **Content Browser**, navigate to **All > Fortnite > Devices**, and search for **island settings**, then drag it into the viewport.

[![island settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/690a1335-3b86-4ff0-b79c-6d5fa0865b45?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/690a1335-3b86-4ff0-b79c-6d5fa0865b45?resizing_type=fit)

## Island Settings and the Details Panel

The settings nest within the **IslandSettings Details** panel.

[![This image shows all of the island settings collapsed. The top setting, Transform, is not an island setting. It refers to the position of the Island Settings device on the island.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/63fa1ae9-f430-489f-ab98-e029db8a89f5?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/63fa1ae9-f430-489f-ab98-e029db8a89f5?resizing_type=fit)

This image shows all of the island settings collapsed. The top setting, Transform, is not an island setting, but refers to the position of the Island Settings device on the island.

For example, if you expand **Mode**, you can access the setting groups beneath this, and continue to expand:

[![This shows the Structure and Matchmaking setttings below Mode expanded.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9fac9965-3c87-4337-8200-b0a874caed88?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9fac9965-3c87-4337-8200-b0a874caed88?resizing_type=fit)

This shows the Structure and Matchmaking setttings below Mode expanded.

Hover over a setting to display tooltips.

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b231f052-87a8-40e7-9648-8e9200a89cc1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b231f052-87a8-40e7-9648-8e9200a89cc1?resizing_type=fit)

The tooltips provide good descriptions of each setting. If you want more information, you can also see the corresponding setting descriptions in the linked Creative pages.

Some settings require a numerical value to be entered while others can be chosen from a dropdown list.

[![drop down menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/57214ce4-7e87-48ab-98ab-17d26c1ec439?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/57214ce4-7e87-48ab-98ab-17d26c1ec439?resizing_type=fit)

You can quickly find any of the settings below by using the search bar on the Details panel.

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/18c61284-8b6f-4753-95f3-6ab5ec8b6c81?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/18c61284-8b6f-4753-95f3-6ab5ec8b6c81?resizing_type=fit)

Individual players' settings and permissions may further restrict with whom a player can communicate.  **All**: Chat on the Game Channel is unrestricted.  **Team**: Players see only their team members on the Game Channel.  **None**: Disables the Game Channel for all players. |
| Attenuate Voice | On, Off | This setting enables or disables Attenuation Voice in the Game Channel for this island.  When enabled, the speaker’s voice is heard at full volume up to Full Volume Distance and fades to inaudible at the Falloff Distance.  When disabled, the speaker’s voice is heard at a constant volume level to all listeners, regardless of their relative positions. |
| Attenuation Shape | Sphere, Cone and Sphere | Determines the shape of the speaking player’s voice.  **Sphere**: Radiates in a distance around the speaker.  **Cone**: Projected outward from the speaker, like a megaphone. |

| Spatialize Voice | On, **Off** | When enabled the speaker's voice emits from their pawn within the game and pans as the listener moves around the speaker. This allows players to use audio to locate each other. When disabled, speakers' voices are monophonic. |

| Occlusion Interpolation Time | **1.0** seconds, Pick a time in seconds | Defines the time it takes for a speaker's volume to fade out or in when becoming obstructed or not obstructed. The lower the value the more responsive the fade. High values can result in speakers being heard long after they become included or not heard for a time after being unobstructed. |
| Focused Listening | **On**, Off | Available when voices are spatialized. When enabled a listener uses a volume to hear what is in front of them more clearly to achieve a more natural hearing experience. Outside of that volume the speaking player's voice volume drops to a specified minimum level. |
| Full Volume Listening Angle | **20** degrees, Pick an angle 0-60 degrees | Defines the width in front of a listening player where the other speaking player's voices are heard at full volume. |
| Falloff Listening Angle | **90** degrees, Pick an angle 0-90 degrees | Defines the width beyond the listening half-volume angle over which voice volume fades to the minimum. Helps simulate how people hear more clearly what is in front of them. |
| Minimum Listening Multiplier | **0.3**, Pick a multiplier 0-1.0 | Defines the minimum volume for speakers outside the listener's full focus angle. Zero completely mutes the speaking players. |

## Debug

The debug settings can be changed at [runtime](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#runtime) in UEFN when you're playtesting. These settings do not affect published islands.

The **Debug** category provides a way to debug the movement of [AI](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#ai) entities on your island (such as guards or wildlife). While some of the options available on this tab are only useful if you're working in [Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#unreal-editor-for-fortnite), others — particularly the navigation option — are also useful in Fortnite Creative.

Debug settings can be managed from **Fortnite Creative** or from **UEFN**. Any toggle settings you change here are reflected in the [Island Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/island-settings-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite#useroptions-debug) in UEFN, and vice versa.

These options are on/off toggles, and they all default to Off.

The mesh shows up in Fortnite Creative whether you're in [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode) or [Play mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-mode).
