# UI Materials Collection

Create customized materials for stat tracking and customizing a UI.

![UI Materials Collection](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/50442c8b-3315-4034-87f2-09a5e3a14b38?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

**Primary materials** are materials with multiple materials functions built into them which provides a way to create dynamic and highly customizable materials with as few materials as possible.

Creating complex materials for tracking player stats and customizing UI textures is time consuming and requires deep knowledge of [material functions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/material-functions-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and material set up. To make custom UI materials more accessible, Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) has a series of highly customizable primary materials that can be used for [meter materials](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/meter-material-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and [textures](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#texture).

## UI Materials

You can find the UI Materials folder in the content browser under **Fortnite** > **UI** > **Materials**. The materials are split into two types:

- **Meter Materials**: Typically used for measuring health and shields.
- **Textures**: Typically used as a iconography and in UI animations.

## Create a Material Instance

To use a material from the UI folder, you must turn it into a material instance. Material instances use less memory than materials, and are much more customizable in [UMG](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#umg) due to the parameters available.

Parameters are manipulated in the [View Model](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#view-model) where they are bound to a device function or Verse code that manipulates the material into behaving a certain way. To create a material instance from a material, follow these steps:

A material instance automatically generates in the main project folder.

## Linear Delta Meter

The Linear Delta Meter has a number of customizable parameters that provide a way for you to customize the empty meter, delta meter, and full meter. You can use the meter parameters with the [View Model](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#view-model) in [UMG](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/UMG?application_version=5.7) and in Verse code through Verse fields. Use the table below to learn more about using the different parameters.

### Basic Parameters

Basic stat-tracking parameters.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Parameter** | **Description** | **GIF** |
| **Animate Delta** | An animation that visualizes the delta between the full meter and the empty meter.   - **0-1** Animates progress to the delta value. - **1-0** Animates progress from the delta value.   The material function **ConstantBiasScale** drives the delta marker between the established minimum and maximum values.  In the [View Model](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#view-model), this parameter is bound in the Sequencer to animate the meter movement. |  |
| **Delta** | A layer that showcases the difference between the previous progress and the current progress.   - Delta **more than** **0** shows progress lost. - Delta **less than 0** shows progress gained.   The material function **Stepped Gradient** drives the delta marker between established minimum and maximum values.  This parameter is bound in the View Model to the **Brush** binding. |  |
| **Progress** | Progress determines how fast the bars move from one end of the bar to the other.  The **Progress value** should be between **0** and **1** when the **ProgressIsNormalized** parameter equals 1.  The material function **Linear Time** drives the delta marker between established minimum and maximum values.  This parameter is bound to the **Brush** binding in the View Model using **Set Scalar Parameter** to track the player’s progress using the **Progress parameter** in the material instance. |  |
| **Progress Is Normalized** | ProgressNormalized affects the **Progress**, **ProgressRangeMin** and **ProgressRangeMax** values.  **Normalized = 1.0** means that the range of Progress will be between 0 to 1 (as its normalized to a standard range to make it standardized).  **Normalized = 0.0** means the range of Progress will be between **ProgressRangeMin** and **ProgressRangeMax** - you can decide what the floor and ceiling values of Progress are. Useful if you don't want to convert raw values (e.g. Health) to a 0 to 1 range. |  |
| **Parameter Minimum Range** | The smallest amount that shows on the meter. When the tracked stat goes down, the minimum range is the last point on the scale shown before complete depletion of the tracked stat.  This parameter is typically bound to health or shields in the View Model and in Verse fields. |  |
| **Parameter Maximum Range** | The largest amount on the meter.  his sets the maximum range for the Progress parameter, which is typically bound to a player’s health or shields in the View Model and in Verse fields. |  |

The **Progress value** should be between **0** and **1** when the **ProgressIsNormalized** parameter equals **1**.  The material function **Linear Time** drives the delta marker between established minimum and maximum values.  This parameter is bound to the **Brush** binding in the View Model using **Set Scalar Parameter** to track the player’s progress using the **Progress parameter** in the material instance. |  |
| **Progress Is Normalized** | ProgressNormalized affects the **Progress**, **ProgressRangeMin** and **ProgressRangeMax** values.  **Normalized = 1.0** means that the range of Progress will be between 0 to 1 (as its normalized to a standard range to make it standardized).  **Normalized = 0.0** means the range of Progress will be between **ProgressRangeMin** and **ProgressRangeMax** - you can decide what the floor and ceiling values of Progress are. Useful if you don't want to convert raw values (e.g. Health) to a 0 to 1 range. |  |
| **Parameter Range Minimum** | The smallest amount that shows on the meter.

## Texture Meter

The Texture Meter has a number of customizable parameters that you use with the View Model in UMG and in Verse code through Verse Fields. Use the table below to learn more about using the different parameters.

### Basic Parameters

Basic stat tracking parameters.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Parameters** | **Description** | **GIF** |
| **Progress** | Progress determines how fast the bars progress from one end of the bar to the other.  The **Progress** **value** should be between **0** and **1** when the **ProgressIsNormalized** parameter equals **1**.  The material function **Linear Time** drives the delta marker between established minimum and maximum values.  This parameter is bound to the **Brush** binding in the View Model using **Set Scalar Parameter** to track the player’s progress using the **Progress parameter** in the material instance. |  |
| **Progress Is Normalized** | ProgressNormalized affects the **Progress**, **ProgressRangeMin** and **ProgressRangeMax** values.  **Normalized = 1.0** means that the range of Progress will be between 0 to 1 (as its normalized to a standard range to make it standardized).  **Normalized = 0.0** means the range of Progress will be between **ProgressRangeMin** and **ProgressRangeMax** - you can decide what the floor and ceiling values of Progress are. Useful if you don't want to convert raw values (e.g. Health) to a 0 to 1 range. |  |
| **Parameter Minimum Range** | The smallest range amount that shows on the meter. When the stat being tracked goes down, the minimum range is the last point on the scale shown before the complete depletion of the tracked stat.  This parameter is typically bound to health or shields in the View Model and in Verse fields. |  |
| **Parameter Maximum Range** | The largest range amount that shows on the meter.  This sets the maximum range for the Progress parameter which is typically bound to a player’s health or shields in the View Model and in Verse fields. |  |
| **Bar Scale** | Determines the scale of the overall bar meter.  Larger values increase the meter’s scale, smaller values decrease the meter’s scale. |  |
| **Bar Shape Softness** | Determines how hard or soft the edges of the meter appear.  Smaller values increase the sharp appearance of the meter’s edges, larger values increase the softness of the meter’s edges. |  |
| **Bar Size** | Determines the size and appearance of the meter.  Larger values decrease the appearance of the meter. Smaller values increase the size of the meter. |  |
| **Edge Softness** | Determines the appearance of the fill material’s edge.  Smaller values cause a sharper appearance to the material’s edge, larger numbers increase the softness of the fill material’s edge. |  |
| **Fill Direction** | Determines the direction of the fill material.  A value of **0.0** causes the fill material to start from the left. Values **larger than 0.0** cause the fill material to start from the right. |  |
| **Fill Vertical** | Determines the axis and direction of the fill material.  A value of **0.0** causes the fill material to start from the left along the **X-axis**. Values **larger than 0.0** cause the fill material to start from the top of the meter and fill along the **Y-axis**. |  |
| **Rotation** | Rotates the meter from the center.  This parameter provides a way to make the meter stand vertically, or off center. |  |
| **Shine Offset** | Determines the Shine placement on the meter.  Values closer to **-1.0** begin the shine offset on the right side of the meter. Values closer to **0**.0 move the shine offset to the left side of the meter. |  |
| **Stroke Size** | Determines the size of the stroke around the meter.  Smaller values decrease the stroke size. Larger values increase the stroke size. |  |
