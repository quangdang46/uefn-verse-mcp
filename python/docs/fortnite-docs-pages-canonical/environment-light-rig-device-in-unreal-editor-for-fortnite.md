# Environment Light Rig Device

Add dynamic lighting and reflections to your project to create custom world lighting.

![Environment Light Rig Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d41c4d02-684d-4f94-ab2d-0026d95c697e?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

**Environment Light Rig** provides a way for creators to add global world lighting to their island.

Start with the adjustments that matter most, like time of day, sunlight color, skylight color, and temperature. After these, you can add more refined changes, like lens flares or lens effects such as vignetting and chromatic aberration.

Think of it as a way to create custom sunlight, moonlight, horizon, reflections and much more. Bold, incremental changes are recommended to establish a middle ground for your natural lighting. Create your project’s base lighting first with as few adjustments as possible, then work on the unique look of your project.

Establishing your base lighting with minimal adjustments means you won’t have to start from scratch with your lighting every time you make adjustments.

The Environment Light Rig controls the lighting for the entire island, therefore you can only place this device once.

Disable the **Time of Day Manager** from **World Settings** to use this device.

| Option | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Light** |  |  |
| **Intensity** | **10.0**, Select an intensity level. | The maximum amount of illumination from the light in lux. |
| **Light Color** | Select a color from the color wheel or add values to the RGB fields when you expand the option. | Filters the color of the light. This can change the light’s effective intensity. |
| **Source Angle** | **1.5**, Select an angle. | The angle of the source light is set in degrees (also known as angular diameter). |
| Source **Soft  Angle** | **0.0**, Select and angle. | The soft light source in degrees. |
| **Use Temperature** | **Off**, On | When set to **Off**, white light will be the default filter color. Toggling the option **On** means you can use the **Temperature** setting. |
| **Temperature** | **6500.0**, Select a color temperature amount. | Determines the color of the filter used on the lighting source. |
| **Affects World** | **On**, Off | Determines whether the light can affect the world or not. A disabled light will not contribute light to the scene in any way.  This setting cannot be changed at runtime and unbuilds lighting when changed.  Setting this effect to false has the same effect as deleting the light so it’s useful for non-destructive lighting tests. |
| **Cast Shadows** | **On**, Off | Determines whether the light should cast shadows. |
| **Indirect Lighting Intensity** | **2.0**, Select an intensity. | Scales the lighting contribution from this light. |
| **Volumetric Scattering Intensity** | **0.0**, Select an intensity. | The intensity of the volumetric scattering from that light. This scales intensity and Light Color. |
| **Advanced** | Expand the option | Has additional lighting settings for lighting channels and volumetric shadows. |
| **Specular Scale** | Select a specular scale setting. | Multiplier on specular highlights.  Use only with great care! Any value besides 1 is not physical.  This setting can be used to artistically remove highlights mimicking polarizing filters or photo touch up. |
| **Shadow Resolution Scale** | Select a shadow resolution scale. | Scales the resolution of shadowmaps used to shadow this light. By default shadowmap resolution is chosen based on screen size of the caster.  Setting the scale to zero disables shadowmaps, but does not disable shadows. For example, Contact Shadows remain enabled.  Shadowmap resolution is still clamped by 'r.Shadow.MaxResolution'. |
| **Shadow Bias** | Select a bias. | Controls how accurate self shadowing of whole scene shadows from this light are.  At 0, shadows will start at their caster surface, but there will be many self shadowing artifacts.  At larger values, shadows will start further from their caster, and there won't be self shadowing artifacts but objects might appear to fly.  Around 0.5 seems to be a good tradeoff. This also affects the soft transition of shadows. |
| **Shadow Slope Bias** | Select a Shadow Slope Bias. | Controls how accurate self shadowing of whole scene shadows from this light are.  This works in addition to Shadow Bias by increasing the amount of bias depending on the slope of a surface.  At 0, shadows will start at their caster surface, but there will be many self shadowing artifacts.  At larger values, shadows will start further from their caster, and there won't be self shadowing artifacts but objects might appear to fly.  Around 0.5 seems to be a good tradeoff. This also affects the soft transition of shadows. |
| **Shadow Filter Sharpen** | Select a shadow filter sharpen amount. | Amount to sharpen shadow filtering. |
| **Contact Shadow Length** | Select a contact shadow length. | Length of screen space ray trace for sharp contact shadows.  This setting can be disabled when set to zero. |

| **Lighting Channels** | **0**, 1, 2, Expand option to select channel directly | Determines the default channel for primitive and lights. |
| **Cast Volumetric Shadow** | **Off**, On | Determines whether the light shadows volumetric fog. Disabling this can save GPU time. |
| **Rendering** |  |  |
| **Visible** | **On**, Off | Whether to completely draw the primitive; if false, the primitive is not drawn, does not cast a shadow. |
| **Use Attach Parent Bound** | **Off**, On | If true, this component uses its parent bounds when attached. This can be a significant optimization with multiple components attached together. |
| **Light Shafts** |  |  |
| **Light Shaft Occlusion** | **Off**, On | Determines whether to occlude fog and atmosphere in scattering with screen space blurred occlusion from this light.    When set to On, the Occlusion Mask Darkness and Occlusion Depth Range options become available. |
| **Occlusion Mask Darkness** | Select an occlusion mask darkness amount. | Controls how dark the occlusion masking is, a value of 1 results in no darkening term. |
| **Occlusion Depth Range** | **1000000.0**, Select an occlusion depth range amount | Everything closer to the camera than this distance will occlude light shafts. |
| **Light Shaft Bloom** | **Off**, On | Determines whether to render a light shaft bloom for this light.  For Directional Lights, the color around the light direction will be blurred radially and added back to the scene. For point lights, the color on pixels closer than the light’s Source radius will be blurred radially and added back to the scene.    When set to On, the Bloom Scale, Bloom Threshold, and Bloom Max Brightness options become available. |
| **Bloom Scale** | **0.2**, Select a Bloom Scale amount | Scales the additive color. |
| **Bloom Threshold** | **0.0**, Select a Bloom Threshold amount. | Scene color must be larger than this to create a bloom around the light shafts. |
| **Bloom Max Brightness** | **100,0**, Select a Bloom Max Brightness amount. | After exposure is applied, if the scene color brightness number is larger than Bloom Max Brightness, the scene color brightness will be rescaled down to Bloom Max Brightness. |
| **Bloom Tint** | **White**, Select a color. | Multiplies against scene color to create the bloom color.  Expanding this option provides the means for you to select the individual RGBY amounts for the Bloom Tint color. |
| **Cascade Shadow Maps** |  |  |
| **Dynamic Shadow Distance** | Select a dynamic shadow distance. | How far Cascade Shadow Map dynamic shadows will cover for a moveable light, measured from the camera.  A value of 0 disables the dynamic shadow. |
| **Num Dynamic Shadow Cascades** | Select a number of dynamic shadow cascades. | Number of cascades to split the view frustrum into for the whole scene dynamic shadow.  More cascades result in better shadow resolution, but adds significant rendering cost. |
| **Distribution Exponent** | Select a distribution amount. | Controls whether the cascades are distributed closer to the camera (large exponent) or further from the camera (smaller exponent).  An exponent of 1 means that cascade transitions will happen at a distance proportional to their resolution. |
| **Transition Fraction** | Select a transition fraction amount. | Proportion of fade region between cascades.  Pixels within the fade region of two cascades have their shadows blended to avoid hard transitions between quality levels.   - A value of zero eliminates the fade region, creating hard transitions. - Higher values increase the size of the fade region, creating more gradual transitions between cascades. - The value expressed as a percentage proportion (for example, 0.1 = 10% overlap).   Ideal values are the smallest possible which hide the transition. An increased fade region size can cause an increase in shadow rendering cost. |
| **Distance Fadeout Fraction** | Select a distance fadeout fraction amount. | Controls the size of the fade out region at the far extent of the dynamic shadow's influence. This  is specified as a fraction of DynamicShadowDistance. |
| **Advanced** | Expand the option | Has an additional option for attaching a parent bounding box. |
| **Far Shadow Cascade Count** | Select a far shadow cascade amount. | - 0 = no Far Shadow Cascades   Otherwise the number of cascades between DynamicShadowDistance and FarShadowDistance that are covered by Far Shadow Cascade. |
| **Far Shadow Distance** | Select a far shadow distance amount. | Distance at which the far shadow cascade should end. Far shadows will cover the range between "Dynamic Shadow Distance" and this distance. |
| **Distance Field Shadows** |  |  |
| Distance Field Shadows | **On**, Off | Whether to use ray traced distance field area shadows.  the project setting bGenerateMeshDistanceFields must be enabled for this to have effect.  Distance field shadows support area lights so they create soft shadows with sharp contacts.  They have less aliasing artifacts than standard shadowmaps, but inherit all the limitations of distance field representations (only uniform scale, no deformation).  These shadows have a low per-object cost and don't depend on triangle count so they are effective for distant shadows from a dynamic sun. |
| **Advanced** | Expand the option | Has an additional option for attaching a parent bounding box. |
| **Ray Start Offset Depth Scale** | Select a ray start offset depth amount. | Controls how large of an offset ray traced shadows have from the receiving surface as the camera gets further away.  This can be useful to hide self-shadowing artifacts from low resolution distance fields on huge static meshes. |
| **Light Function** |  |  |
| **Light Function Material** | Select a material from the dropdown menu. | The light function material applied to this light.  Only non-lightmapped lights can have a light function.  Light functions are supported within the Volumetric Fog, but only for Directional, Point, and Spot Lights. Rect Lights are not supported.  Emissive materials are not usable as a light source on lower-end devices because they cannot use dynamic Global Illumination.  When you apply a material, the **Light Fade Scale**, **Fade Distance**, and **Disabled Brightness** options become available. |
| **Light Function Scale** | Select a Light Function Scale amount for the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis. | Scales light function projection. X and Y scale in directions perpendicular to the light’s direction, Z scales along the light direction. |
| **Fade Distance** | **1000000.0**, Select a Fade Distance amount. | Distance at which the light function should be completely faded to Disabled Brightness. This is useful for hiding aliasing from light functions applied in the distance. |
| **Disabled Brightness** | **0.5**, Select a disabled Brightness factor | Brightness factor applied to the light when the light function is specified but disabled. For example, in scene captures that use SceneCapView_LitNoShadows.  This should be set to the average brightness of the light function material’s emissive input, which should be between 0 and 1. |
| **Tags** |  |  |
| **Component Tags** | Create an array for your lighting component. | You can use array tags for grouping and categorizing. You can also access these tags from scripting. |
| **Performance** |  |  |
| **Max Draw Distance** | **2800.0**, Select a Max Draw Distance. | The max distance for a mesh to be rendered. |
| **Max Distance Fade Range** | **2048.0**, Select a Max Distance Fade range. | The max distance for a mesh to be rendered for the fade to be rendered. |

### Lumen Exposure

You can use Lumen Exposure from the Environment Light Rig, or you can add it from the **Content Browser** to a project on its own. For more information, refer to the [Lumen Exposure Manager](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-the-lumen-exposure-manager-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) document.

### Basic Exposure and Color Grading

These components have the same options, but affect different aspects of lighting. You can use Exposure settings within Post Process Volumes to control the final image that renders. You can use color grading to correct the colors used with Directional Light, Sky Atmosphere, and Sky Light settings.
