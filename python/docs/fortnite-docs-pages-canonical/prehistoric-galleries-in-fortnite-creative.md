# Stat Powerup Device Design Examples
See how you can use this device in conjunction with the Stat Creator device for custom stats or deliver pre-made stats for your players!
![Stat Powerup Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ae028ead-c809-4545-96fd-745183b71b6a?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
You can use a **Stat Powerup** device to adjust in-game statistics (stats) or assign custom stats when you use it with the [Stat Creator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/assets/using-stat-creator-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device.
##  Basic Score Powerup
The Stat Powerup device, at its simplest, is a great way to give the player a temporary boost to a specific stat value. In this case, the player will get a score boost!
###  Devices Used
  * 1 x [Stat Powerup](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-stat-powerup-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
  * 1 x [Player Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device

###  Modify Island Settings
Make the following modifications to the island settings.
  1. Go to **Island Settings > User Interface**.
  2. Under **HUD** , change **HUD Info Type** to **Score**.
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/329597c5-be44-4b37-a7e1-adfd5ff11269?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/329597c5-be44-4b37-a7e1-adfd5ff11269?resizing_type=fit)

You now have the basic functionality for a score powerup!
###  Design Tip
As with the Stat Counter device, the Stat Powerup device can be configured to affect a number of built-in stats such as **Score** , **Eliminations** , and **Lap Time**.
In the next two examples, you'll also see how it can be configured to affect custom stats with the Stat Creator device!
##  Build a Grind Tracker
You can configure the Stat Powerup device to provide a constant stat effect, then turn it on and off based on events from other devices.
In this example, you’ll use the **infinite effect** functionality to keep track of the player’s **Grind Score**!
###  Devices Used

###  Set Up the Basic Gameplay
  1. Start with the **Tilted Towers POI Island** starter island.
  2. Place a **Player Spawner** device on top of a building.
  3. Place a **Grind Rail** device that begins on the edge of that building.
  4. Customize the first **Grind Rail Control Point** :
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2e9300ac-eb6c-4623-83a6-87bcb1d0f6f9?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2e9300ac-eb6c-4623-83a6-87bcb1d0f6f9?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
Target Intensity |  5,000.0 |  This will give the grind rail a natural curve as you place more Control Points.
  5. Duplicate this control point a number of times to create a grind rail that snakes between the buildings in the city.

###  Configure the Custom Stat
  1. Place a **Stat Creator** device and customzie it:
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4c417c7e-a3d9-4eb4-bee2-bac30ddaf1e9?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4c417c7e-a3d9-4eb4-bee2-bac30ddaf1e9?resizing_type=fit)

  3. Configure the following functions on the Stat Powerup device so that it starts to increase the player’s **Grind Score** when they begin grinding and stops when they leave the grind rail:
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/96d4c0b4-c154-4887-9484-71066761c2cb?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/96d4c0b4-c154-4887-9484-71066761c2cb?resizing_type=fit)

  5. Configure the following event on the Stat Creator device to grant the Jules Glider Gun when the player reaches the maximum Grind Score value.

###  Design Tip
Infinite Stat Powerups are a very useful way to apply constant changes to a stat value. As you’ll see in the next example, adding a Stat Counter that can override the stat value creates interesting and new stat interactions!
##  Build a Hacking Minigame
The Stat Powerup device can also be configured to **decrease** a player’s stats instead of increasing them. In this example, you’ll use the Stat Powerup device with a Stat Counter device to create a constantly decreasing stat that the player must increase!
