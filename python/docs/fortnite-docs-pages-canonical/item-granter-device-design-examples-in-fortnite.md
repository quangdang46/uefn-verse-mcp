![Item Granter Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2a475779-2e0e-4827-a341-b4a8fd0c836e?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

You can use the **Item Granter** device to place items into player inventories at any point in a game. This page walks you through three different examples of ways to use this device.

## Armed from the Start!

The Item Granter is great for giving players a weapon at the beginning of a game.

### Devices Used

- 1 x [Item Granter](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
- 1 x [Player Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device
- 1 x [Creature Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-creature-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device

### Set Up the Devices

You now have the basic functionality for a starting weapon.

### Design Tip

This is configured so that all players in the game will receive the same weapon at the beginning of the game. If you want specific players to receive specific weapons, use the built-in events to trigger specific Item Granters from different Player Spawners.

Similar functionality can be achieved with other devices, such as the Team Settings & Inventory Device, but this is one simple way to give the player a starting weapon.

## Weapon Upgrades

You can register multiple items to the Item Granter and decide how the device should grant these items — either all at once or by cycling through the items. In this example, you’ll use the cycling functionality to create a system that upgrades player weapons as they get eliminations.

### Devices Used

3. Place an **Item Granter**.
4. In order, register a Tactical Assault Rifle of each rarity (**Common**, **Uncommon**, **Rare**, **Epic**, **Legendary**).
5. Customize the Item Granter:

    | Text Color | White |

### Bind Functions / Events

[Direct event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#directeventbinding) is how you set devices to communicate directly with other devices. This involves setting [functions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#function) and [events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#event) for the devices involved.

You now have the basic functionality for an elimination-based weapon upgrade system!

### Design Tip

Item Granters can cycle through items in a few different ways. In this example, each item can only be granted once, but the device can be configured to continue granting items in a repeating pattern! Also, the **Cycle to Random Item** event can be used to trigger random item grants!

## Build an Automation Game!

Item Granters can also be configured to grant items repeatedly at a regular interval. In this example, you’ll use Item Granters to set up a basic automation game in which players can build “factories” that produce resources for them!

### Modify Island Settings

Make the following modifications to the island settings.

You now have an automation game in which the player can set up resource factories!

### Design Tip

Think of ways that you can expand this game. Consider adding more types of resources and factories, or use Conditional Buttons with multiple Key Items to create a complex crafting system.

Players love games where they can make efficient production systems, so look to other games in the genre for inspiration!
