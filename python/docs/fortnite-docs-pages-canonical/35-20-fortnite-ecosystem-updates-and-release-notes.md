The Olympus Prefabs & Galleries have landed in Creative! Check them out along with the Brawler’s Battleground Prefabs & Galleries. You can now use Bubble Chat for the text chat on your islands, and loading screen behavior is improved when entering your Fortnite Creative and UEFN islands. Also, the Creator Portal terms are getting a fresh coat of paint! Read all about it below.

## Create Dynamic Social Environments with Bubble Chat

Bubble chat

You can now enable **Bubble Chat** for the text chat system in your islands, and have in-game conversations displayed directly above your players. Choose from a range of preset styles, like Rounded, Pop, Neon, and Comic, or create your own custom look with the UEFN widget. You can customize the player experience by setting how far away the text bubble can be seen by players, how long it stays visible on screen, and whether it fades when players walk behind objects.

## Improved Loading Screen

Players will notice improved loading screen behavior when entering islands. Characters and devices, including custom cameras, will be properly initialized before the loading screen is dismissed. Creators do not need to take any action to see these benefits—these improvements are being applied to all UEFN and Creative islands.

## Creator Portal Experience Updates

You’ll notice updated terminology throughout Creator Portal to make each stage of the publishing process easier to understand. Here some of the key changes:

- **Publish** now only refers to making an approved island release publicly available to players.
- **Create a release** is the process of submitting an island release for moderation.
- **Active release** is now called **Published release**.
- **Inactive release** is now **Unpublished release**.

#### Simpler Island Visibility States

To make it easier to know how playable and discoverable your island is, we’ve simplified island visibility to just three states:

- **Listed**: Your island is published and playable. It will show up on your public Creator page, it’s eligible to be featured in Discover, and it will show up in search results.
- **Unlisted**: Your island is published and playable, but it won’t show up on your public Creator page and it’s not eligible for Discover. Only players with the island code will be able to find and play it.
- **Unpublished**: Your island is not published, it’s not playable by the public and it’s not generating engagement revenue or analytics data. It could be that the island has never been published, that you unpublished it yourself, or it was unpublished by moderation as a result of a trust and safety violation.

You might be wondering, “What happened to **Deactivated**?” Going forward, instead of deactivating an island, you’ll simply unpublish it. The flow and outcome are the same, and it creates a single unified state for all islands that are not publicly playable for any reason.

When you’re ready to make your island public again, simply go to the **Release** tab, select an approved release, click **Publish Now**, select your desired visibility, and click **Publish**.

#### Improved Project Filtering

We’ve also made it easier to find important projects by adding filtering to the Projects page. You can now filter project tiles by visibility state (Listed, Unlisted or Unpublished). This helps you to get island-specific data for your high-performing islands or surface islands that may need attention.
