# Orbit Camera Devices

Set up a camera that follows a character but that the player can rotate freely.

![Orbit Camera Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4bbb61d7-442d-48fc-89bc-bd059912f73f?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The **Camera: Orbit** (Orbit Camera) device provides a view that follows a target player character but that the player can rotate to freely look around.

This camera differs from a **[Fixed Point Camera](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-fixed-point-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** device, where the camera maintains a set location, and a [Fixed Angle Camera](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-fixed-angle-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device, where the camera moves in sync with the player at a locked angle that provides a consistent perspective. The orbit camera follows the player, but the player can still rotate the view to see in different directions without turning.

You can use a [Third Person Controls](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-third-person-controls-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device with this camera, but it also works without it.

To learn more about how to use the camera and control devices together, see [Designing with Cameras and Controls](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/designing-with-cameras-and-controls-in-fortnite-creative).

## Camera Terms and Definitions

When building a game, cameras are used for lots of different purposes. There are some specialized terms used for these in-game cameras that you might be unfamiliar with. Many of these terms are used in the device options for this and other camera devices. The list below gives some of these terms and their definitions.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **field of view** | The term **field of view** (or **FOV** for short) refers to what the camera can actually "see". The field of view is represented as an angle, and is measured in degrees. Angles have two sides, joined at a point called the **vertex**. With cameras, the vertex is the lens (virtual in this case) of the camera. The arms of the angle spread up and down (the vertical axis) from that vertex. The higher the number of degrees, the wider the angle, and the more the camera can see. |
| **pitch, yaw** | **Pitch** and **yaw** are terms originating in aviation. They refer to the different types of rotation a plane can perform when moving. These terms were adopted into 3D design and game development to more precisely define a virtual 3D environment and how things are positioned in that virtual space. Pitch and yaw are measured relative to the object's original position. **Pitch** refers to up and down movement of an object, and **yaw** refers to horizontal left or right movement of an object. **Note**: the **axis of rotation** is different from the direction of movement. For example, if a plane **pitches**, the nose of the plane moves up or down; but the plane is **rotating** on the Y-axis (which is the left-right or east-west horizontal axis). See the terms **X-axis**, **Y-axis**, and **Z-axis** in this table. |
| **angle pitch** | This is a measurement of how much the camera points up or down while framing its target. |
| **angle yaw** | This is a measurement of how much the camera turns left or right while framing its target. |
| **camera offset** | Normally the camera view centers on its target. The **camera offset** is how far from the center the camera view is. The camera can have an offset amount on the X-, Y-, or Z-axis and it can have an offset on more than one axis at a time. |
| **X-axis** | In a 3D space (real or virtual), the X-axis represents horizontal forward/backward (or north/south) movement. |
| **Y-axis** | In a 3D space (real or virtual), the Y-axis represents horizontal left/right (or east/west) movement. |
| **Z-axis** | In a 3D space (real or virtual), the Z-axis represents vertical up/down movement. |
| **camera transition** | When you have multiple cameras active, a **transition** is when you move from one camera view to another. In Fortnite, camera devices have an **In Priority** and an **Out Priority**. The camera transition is determined by the highest priority, comparing the Out Priority of the current camera with the In Priority of the destination camera. |
| **transition types** | **Ease In**: the camera transition will start slowly and speed up as it continues. **Ease Out**: the camera transition will slow down as it ends. **Ease In-Out**: the camera transition will start slowly, speed up, then slow again as it ends. **Linear**: the camera transition moves smoothly from one camera to another at the same speed. **Fade**: The camera will fade in from black and fade out to black. |
| **priority system** | If multiple cameras are assigned to a player, priority determines which camera is active at any point in time. Priority can be set in the device options. If two cameras are tied for the highest priority, the most recently added camera will become active. |
| **boom collision** | In film, a boom jib is an apparatus that holds the camera. Boom operators can move and orient the camera with levers and wheels to get the shot they desire. The Boom Collision properties for fixed angle cameras allow you to determine the behavior of that camera when an object in the scene gets between the camera and its target. |
| **deadzone** | The **deadzone** refers to an established area within which the target can move around without affecting the camera. When the target moves to an edge of the deadzone, the camera will move to follow the target. |
| **look-at location** | Where the camera is looking at any time. With the orbit camera, it might be something other than the player. |
| **soft deadzone** | The area inside of the deadzone where the camera starts to accelerate to follow the player. This area blends the look-at location between remaining stationary and following the target. |

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, we use *italic* in our device docs for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

You can control the position of the camera relative to the target, the size and shape of the camera.

Configure this device with the following options.

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.

| Option | Value | Description |
