# Color Changing Tile Devices

This device creates a tile that changes color when players interact with it.

![Color Changing Tile Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7bca04f2-7970-4065-945e-ec166a738969?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The **Color Changing Tile** device creates a tile that changes colors when players interact with it.

When this device is first [placed](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary), it is a neutral color. When a player steps on the tile or drives a vehicle over it, the tile switches to the color of the player’s team, and remains that color until a player in another team steps on it or drives over it.

This tile can be rotated in all three [axes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary), but [traps](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) and [trick tiles](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) cannot be attached to it.

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device reference documents we use *italic* for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.
