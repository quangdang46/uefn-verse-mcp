# 34.40 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes

Find out what's new with the 34.40 release of Fortnite on April 22, 2025!

![34.40 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/53c7e0a9-f174-4d35-96ed-d72599be2d1c?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The v34.40 update introduces the Armored Transport spawner from Fortnite Battle Royale,  Rebel’s Roost prefabs and galleries, and new characters and tools for those creating Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles islands. Plus, don't forget to update your islands to the Chapter 5 Time of Day Manager before the legacy lighting system is retired on May 2!

## Skydome and Legacy Time of Day Manager Will Be Deprecated at 35.00

This is your final reminder to update your UEFN and Fortnite Creative islands to the Chapter 5 Time of Day Manager (TODM) lighting system. The legacy Time of Day Manager and Skydome device will be retired with the v35.00 update on May 2, 2025.

This change affects islands currently using the Skydome device to create custom lighting. After the device is deprecated, all islands using the Skydome device will retain their gameplay, volume data, and positional data, but lighting will default to the Chapter 5 TODM lighting and ignore any settings used with the Skydome device.

If you have not done so already, upgrade your islands to use the Chapter 5 TODM system with the [Day Sequence device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-day-sequence-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite). You can learn more about how to use the device effectively with the [Day Sequence Starter Island Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/day-sequence-starter-island-template-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

After the Chapter 5 TODM goes into effect, you will no longer be able to publish new islands or republish existing ones that use the Skydome device.

Converting your island to the new TODM is a **one-way conversion**, so back up your island before upgrading your islands.

## Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Refresh!

With this release, there are some rad updates to TMNT islands! First, four new characters have joined the TMNT pizza party: Casey Jones, Bebop, Rocksteady, and Krang. Check them out in the Character, Guard, and NPC Spawner devices!

It’s not just these new foes who are available–now you can get all the TMNT character outfits in the Character, Guard, and NPC Spawner devices!

We’re also introducing the Dimension X Starter island template, which provides an out-of-this world landscape that is the perfect starting point for building multi-dimensional TMNT UEFN adventures. Sculpt the barren landscape and place pools of ooze beneath the swirling skies of outer space!

Lastly, want to add some TMNT flair to existing Fortnite prefabs? You can now use textures from the Graffiti Wall gallery with the [Decal device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/decal-device-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) in UEFN.

## New Device: Armored Transport Spawner

The [Armored Transport](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-armored-transport-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) from Battle Royale is now available for creators to utilize in their island.  Beyond being driven, the vehicle carries a bank vault that players can crack to collect loot. You can use one of the set loot pools or customize it by dropping items on the spawner.

Similar to the Bank Vault, you can control the number of weak points and how they are damaged. You can also control which players can drive the truck and which players can initiate the break-in on the vault.
