At the start of each [round](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#round) players run from the storm trying to reduce the storm damage they take while completing the game’s objectives. The creator’s goal in Storm Wars is to build a map with randomly generated storms for each round they play. After creating this example, the player will know how to use the [Basic Storm Controller device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#basic-storm-controller), the [Random Number Generator device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#random-number-generator), and the [Trigger device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

**Generate Storm on Game Start** |  No |  Each Basic Storm Controller device should be enabled on a signal rather than on Game Start.
**Generate Storm When receiving From** |  Channel 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 |  This sets what channel will trigger the Basic Storm Controller device.
  6. Copy the first Basic Storm Controller then place 3 more in separate locations around the island. This will [spawn](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#spawning) a new storm in a new location at the start of each round.
  7. Edit the second Basic Storm Controller’s **Generate Storm When Receiving From** option to **Channel 2**. Similarly, for the next 2 Basic Storm Controller devices, set one to **Channel 3** , the other to **Channel 4**.

###  Placing the Random Number Generator Device

***Value Limit** |  4 |  Sets the maximum number the Random Number Generator device will be able to generate.
**Pick Each Number Once** |  Yes (Reset on Game Start) |  Ensures that no number is ever chosen more than once in a game.
**Zone** |  Forward |  Sets the direction a zone will be created in by the Random Number Generator device to activate triggers.
**Activate on Game Phase** |  Game Start |  Ensures that the Random Number Generator starts at the game start.
Consider adding the silent option for the device if you place it near the arena, or you can ensure that the device is far enough away from the arena not to be heard during gameplay.
  4. Walk around the RNG. Notice that there are 4 boxes now extending from the device, these are called [volumes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#volume). This device counts as a sequencer, any device placed within its volumes will activate all devices set to accept sequencers when triggered by the RNG.

###  Placing the Trigger Devices

  2. Place one Trigger device in each of these volume boxes.

**Total Rounds** |  4 |  Each round allows the RNG to randomly cycle through the 4 Trigger devices and Basic Storm Controllers.
**Time Limit** |  1 Minute |  Shorten the time limit so you don’t have to wait too long to experience a new storm during each round.

##  Playing Your Game
After creating your own Storm Wars Gameplay Example you’ll have a basic understanding of how storms are generated in Fortnite Battle Royale and Save the World.
Storm Wars can be combined with game modes such as [Lobby Loadout](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/loadout-lobby-in-fortnite-creative) to make even more interesting game modes. You can also use other devices such as the [Advanced Storm Beacon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-advanced-storm-beacon-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [Advanced Storm Controller](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-advanced-storm-controller-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices to increase the complexity of the game.
You can use additional option settings for the Basic Storm Controller that move the storm, control the storm radius and damage dealt by the storm. Combine the Random Number Generator and Triggers with other devices and traps to create a fun and complex game experience by randomly generating animals, enemies, and more.
