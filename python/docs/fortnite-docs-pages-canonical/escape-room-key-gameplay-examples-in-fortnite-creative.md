![Escape Room Key Mechanics](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3eb15b53-e4f8-41b3-9910-4fb09bffb28d?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The player’s goal in an escape room is to find clues that lead them to the objects they need to escape from one or more rooms.

[![An example of an escape room.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a2ee9e9c-3964-4749-b2f2-df82635657cd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a2ee9e9c-3964-4749-b2f2-df82635657cd?resizing_type=fit)

After creating this example, you will know how to use the [Trigger device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative), the [Hud Message device](using-hud-message-devices-in-fortnite-creative), the [Perception Trigger device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-perception-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative), the [Item Placer device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-item-placer-devices-in-fortnite-creative), and the [Lock device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-lock-devices-in-fortnite-creative), and how to use items with Item Spawners.

## Ingredients

[![Lay out the devices in a way that forces players to search for clues, and where they can accidentally set off a trigger that will send them a clue.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/34528bae-7150-43fd-ad24-b1f8c191a7e0?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/34528bae-7150-43fd-ad24-b1f8c191a7e0?resizing_type=fit)

You will need:

| Number | Device |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **2X Trigger device** |
| 2 | **1X Player Spawn Pad device** |
| 3 | **1X Conditional Button device** |
| 4 | **1X Lock device** |
| 5 | **1X End Game device** |
| 6 | **1X HUD Message device** |
| 7 | **1X Prop Manipulator device** |
| 8 | **1X Item Spawner device** |
| 9 | **1X Key item** |

### Items

For this gameplay mechanic to work, you will need to spawn a **key** [item](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#item) using the [Item Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device. The key is consumed by the **Conditional Button** when the player finds and equips it.

To add an item to the Item Spawner device:

## Method

Place the first Trigger device somewhere that players are guaranteed to step on. This provides a way for the HUD Message device to send players their first clue.

The first Trigger device also triggers the Prop Manipulator device, which makes the prop hiding the escape item to disappear, and the Item Spawner to spawn the item.

Place the Trigger device in front of a desk or beside a bed. Don’t place it directly in front of the player. Players should have a chance to explore the room before they get their first clue.

After a player receives a clue, they begin hunting for the items that will help them escape the room. When players find an item, they will equip the item then head for the escape door.

When the player takes the item to the Conditional Button device, the Lock device opens the escape door.

Place the second Trigger device outside of the escape door. When a player unlocks the door and steps on the Trigger device, the End Game device will be triggered to end the game.

Using riddles for clues to key items is not only fun for players, it’s also fun for you. To create riddles, use the following prompts to think about the key items in a unique way:

- Brainstorm words associated with the key item.

## Tips and Tricks

Make players find multiple items before unlocking the door with the [Conditional Button](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative). A Conditional Button can require the player to gather multiple resources and items before unlocking the Lock device.

Use a Trigger device and the Item Spawner device to spawn an item when the player reaches a specific spot inside the escape room.

Use the HUD Message device to send the player a message to double-back and search for additional items, or provide clues about where a player should be searching.

Add a sound when the clue spawns.

## Putting It All Together

You can use this mechanic multiple times in an escape room, or even add onto this mechanic to create a maze.
