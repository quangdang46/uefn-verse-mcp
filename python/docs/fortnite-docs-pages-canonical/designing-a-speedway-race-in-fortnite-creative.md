# Designing a Speedway Race

Build your own lap race using Racetrack Gallery pieces, Accolades devices, and a Race Checkpoint device.

![Designing a Speedway Race](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/19645692-eaa9-4fcf-afd8-e24ff003878e?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

Ready to make your own racetrack? The **Design A Speedway Race** template island is the perfect place to start! With a small track, you can see how the race was set up and configured to create your very own racetrack island. This tutorial is a companion to the template.

The Island Code for the Design A Speedway Race Template is **8331-9445-9319**

To play through this [island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#island), click **CHANGE** on the [Fortnite Lobby](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) screen. On the [Discover](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) screen, click the [Island Code](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#island-code) tab and enter the code for **Design A Speedway Race**. You can look around the tutorial zone before running a race. This tutorial follows the island’s tutorial zone, and walks you through the [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#device) used, as well as offering design tips for customizing your own racetrack experience.

[![high level view of speedway race template in fly mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3fe63a6c-2a28-44a9-b336-b9ef2d67f702?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3fe63a6c-2a28-44a9-b336-b9ef2d67f702?resizing_type=fit)

For information on how to set up your own racetrack course from scratch (create the track, place barriers, and so on), check out the [Car Racing Game tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/design-a-car-racing-game-in-fortnite-creative).

## Using The Template

Use the **Design A Speedway Race** template to create your own racing game.

- Use the **Change Destination** console, then click **Create New**.
- Switch to the **Templates** tab, search for and select **Design A Speedway Race**, then click **Confirm**.
- Wait for the destination to update, then enter.

[![Select the Design A Speedway Race template](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ff202f96-822f-422b-9315-1f1cc0f86638?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ff202f96-822f-422b-9315-1f1cc0f86638?resizing_type=fit)

When you spawn onto the island, you’ll begin in the tutorial zone. This is where you can learn about the devices used to develop the racetrack. The devices are grouped by [game mechanic](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#game-mechanics) in display areas along the pathway. Follow using the guiding arrows on the floor.

[![guiding arrows on the floor](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f817757c-3c34-4716-a1f4-35c264e2c1e2?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f817757c-3c34-4716-a1f4-35c264e2c1e2?resizing_type=fit)

To exit the tutorial zone and go to the racetrack, double-press the spacebar to enable [Fly mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#fly-mode). Move upward or forward from the spawn area. On the [minimap](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#minimap) you will see that the tutorial zone is under and adjacent to the race starting area.

[![minimap of tutorial zone location underneath the racetrack](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/755f09b5-639d-4954-beda-336f3325ebbf?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/755f09b5-639d-4954-beda-336f3325ebbf?resizing_type=fit)

### Disabled Devices

As you explore the tutorial zone, you will find that some of the devices are disabled and are in the display as examples. That means the devices will not automatically work if copied and pasted from the tutorial zone. Instead, find the same device in the racetrack and copy it from there to make sure your new device is enabled with the appropriate settings.

As you go through the tutorial zone, each disabled device is labeled in the device list.

[![example of list of disabled devices in billboard](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a66d0e2-73ae-470e-860c-5c93a3383e34?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a66d0e2-73ae-470e-860c-5c93a3383e34?resizing_type=fit)

## Copying from the Tutorial Zone to Your Island

If you want to use the Tutorial Zone for your own island rather than using the Design A Speedway Race template directly, you can copy parts of the tutorial zone, including the devices and their settings, by using multi-select.

## Tutorial Spawn Pads

Players spawning into the island appear in the tutorial zone before the race starts from a set of 8 [Player Spawn Pads](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative). These are disabled by a [Trigger device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative) when the race starts.

### Player Spawn Pad Modified Options

## Player and Car Spawn

Inside the **Player & Car Spawn** display are the following devices:

- [Player Spawn Pad device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- [Sports Car Spawner device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-sports-car-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

- [Barrier device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-barrier-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

All of the devices in this display are disabled.

With these devices, you can set up each player’s spawn and designated car and counter. When players spawn into the game, they are automatically assigned a car and a number with the Player Counter. The barrier device restricts the car movement until the start of the race. Each Player Spawner, Counter, and Sports Car device runs on [channels](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) 1-8 for each of the 8 players.

[![player and car spawn display](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/efcb9473-0d89-4297-be25-ab21702a3390?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/efcb9473-0d89-4297-be25-ab21702a3390?resizing_type=fit)

### Design Tips

You can change up the feel and theme of the race by changing the vehicle spawner.

For example, for this race we used the Sports Car spawner, but if your racetrack is a dirt road, you could use the **Quadcrash** four-wheeler instead.

If you want a demolition derby instead of a simple race, you can send a signal when a car is destroyed to trigger other effects like eliminations, score awards, or accolades.

## Race Mechanics

Inside the Race Mechanics display are the following devices:

- [Race Checkpoint device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-race-checkpoint-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- [Race Manager device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-race-manager-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- [Accolades device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-accolades-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

The Race Checkpoint device is disabled.

The Race Checkpoint device provides checkpoints throughout the track, and makes sure players cannot go through the checkpoint outside of their car. For more information on restricting players outside of vehicles, see [Exiting Car Mechanics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/designing-a-speedway-race-in-fortnite-creative).

The Race Manager is preset for 4 laps to race completion, to start the race after a countdown, and to display the directional arrow on the [HUD](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#hud).

It is also configured to transmit on channels 31, 33, and 34 for when to initiate the race start, lap completion, and race completion.

The Accolades device is set to award Large [XP](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#xp) on lap completion and Extra Large XP when a player completes the race.

[![race mechanics display](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ea9fb39f-0983-492e-b5e2-caa1c8f217b2?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ea9fb39f-0983-492e-b5e2-caa1c8f217b2?resizing_type=fit)

### Design Tips

If you want to encourage your players to engage in other activities during the race, you can set up accolades that reward them for actions other than completing laps or the race, like completing an optional high jump or collecting all the collectibles you placed around the track.

You can also combine these with score rewards as described below to make these activities even more compelling to players.

## End Game Mechanics

Inside the End Game Mechanics display are the following devices:

- [Timer device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-timer-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- [End Game device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-end-game-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

Both devices are configured and ready to be used.

The Timer and End Game devices work together to trigger the end of the race. The Timer is set to allow players to finish the race within a certain time after the race has been won. Once that time ends, the Timer transmits a signal to the End Game device to end the race.

[![end game mechanics display](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/23c4010e-cda3-461a-83d5-2d476ea8bd4f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/23c4010e-cda3-461a-83d5-2d476ea8bd4f?resizing_type=fit)

| **Completion Behavior** | Channel 37 | Ends the game when receiving a signal on this channel. |

### Design Tips

If you are an advanced user and want to provide a more compelling end-of-race experience, you could set up your race so that once all the players cross the finish line, triggers and teleport devices move the winner, second-place, and third-place players onto a podium (and constrained with invisible barriers), and the other players are teleported in front as an audience (again constrained by an invisible barrier). You can then use the Timer to give the players on the podium 15 or 30 seconds to emote and cheer, before ending the game.

## Lap Display Tower

Inside the Lap Display Tower are the following devices:

- [Player Reference device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-player-reference-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- [Score Manager device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-score-manager-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

Both devices are configured and ready to be used.

The Player Reference tracks a player’s score in relation to the amount of laps they completed. The Reference device is assigned through the Player Spawn Pad number, which ties to the car and Player Counter channel assignments as well.

On the racetrack, there are two Score Manager devices. The first gives players a +1 score increment when they complete a lap. The second gives a +1 score for completing the race. Neither device increments the score, and the score value remains the same at 1.

[![lap display tower display](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/42435e3f-68a3-4970-b23b-bd807f81292c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/42435e3f-68a3-4970-b23b-bd807f81292c?resizing_type=fit)

### Design Tips

Try altering the scores based on different variables within the race track. This can be combined with hard-to-reach optional checkpoints, or gathering items or collectibles on the track to award more points.

You can combine these with Accolades to provide further incentive for players to seek these options.

## Starting Sequence

Inside the Starting Sequence display are the following devices:

- [Sequencer device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-pulse-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- [Customizable Light device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-customizable-light-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- **[Trigger device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative)**
- [HUD Message device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-hud-message-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

The Customizable Light and HUD Message devices are disabled.

The starting sequence is the countdown for when the race begins. When the sequencer triggers, the lights and accompanying HUD messages also kick off in the following Order:

- Red Light, "Ready"
- Yellow Light, "Set"
- Green Light, "Go!"

The Trigger devices activate the lights and HUD messages within the sequence. A final Trigger device then disables the green light so it disappears from the game as the race begins.

[![starting sequence display](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/92f8fffa-d1bc-496c-b0d8-555a12acb5a5?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/92f8fffa-d1bc-496c-b0d8-555a12acb5a5?resizing_type=fit)

The Starting Sequence setup in the tutorial zone then transmits to the Customizable Lights on the actual racetrack. When the race begins, the sequence kicks off and the Lights turn on while the text displays in the HUD. On the racetrack, the Customizable Lights individually flash with each color for the countdown, while the Lights light up the finish line with the color.

### Design Tips

You can add visual effects to the start of the race. Imagine fireworks going off as your racers start out, or explosions behind the racers.

If you want to make your race really interesting, you can add temporary [buffs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#buff) or debuffs that trigger when the race begins.

## Exiting Car Mechanics

Inside the Exiting Car Mechanics display are 8 **Trigger** devices. The devices are configured and ready to be used.

Because the ability to exit the car cannot be turned off, you can use trigger devices instead to restrict player movement. The triggers are set to channels 1-8 and transmit signals to each Sports Car device. If a player exits their car, they will be put back into the car after 3 seconds.

### Trigger Device Options

| Option Name | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Delay** | 3 Seconds | How long it takes to trigger the player being placed back in the car. |
| **Trigger Sound** | Disabled | No sound plays when the trigger activates. |
| **Trigger VFX** | Disabled | No visual effects play when the trigger activates. |
| **Visible in Game** | No | The trigger is not visible in-game. |
| **Trigger When Receiving From** | Channels 40-47 | The respective channels that signal to activate each of the triggers. |
| **When Triggered Transmit On** | Channel 1-8 | The respective channels that each of the triggers send a signal on when activated. |

### Design Tips

You can use this effect to create a hybrid experience between racing and exploring, where the players have a longer time before they are returned to their cars. You could then have them do a timed scavenger hunt for collectibles, or have them explore a junkyard with hidden upgrades for their cars.

## Visual Devices

Inside the Visual Devices display are thefollowing devices:

- [HUD Controller device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-hud-controller-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- [VFX Spawner device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-vfx-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- [Skydome device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-skydome-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

The VFX Spawner device is disabled.

The HUD Controller manages what does and does not display on the HUD. Since this is a very specific kind of experience, the usual Fortnite HUD elements like the minimap, the resources, build, and equipment bars are not needed and are hidden.

The VFX device adds some fun and flavor to your racetrack by celebrating the winner at the end of the race with balloons and confetti.

The Skydome device is specifically used within the tutorial zone to add light to the area.

## Team Names and Colors

Inside the Team Names and Colors display are 8 [Team Settings and Inventory devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-team-settings-and-inventory-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

All the devices are configured and ready to be used.

The Team Settings and Inventory devices operate on channels 1-8 and transmits to a specific Player Spawn Pad. The color and names help distinguish between different players when on the racetrack.
