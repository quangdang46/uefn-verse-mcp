# Walker NPC Template

Learn the ways of the Walker through level design scenarios and new hero weapons in this learning template for The Walking Dead Universe.

![Walker NPC Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/caacb39e-52ff-41f6-9471-536bf78b87bc?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

A horde of deadly **Walkers** from **The Walking Dead Universe** are shambling their way into Fortnite islands. Use the **Walker NPC** learning template in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) to meet this enemy type and learn how to incorporate them in the level design of your islands for unique experiences. The template includes billboards, switches, and gameplay examples for in-editor learning.

Use this guide as a companion to the template to dive deeper into the following:

- Walker NPC setup
- Weapons gameplay
- Level design scenarios with Walker NPCs
- Camera choices
- Plug-and-play custom UI for health and selected weapon
- Heavy Linework post-process effect

## Getting Started

To access the template, follow these steps:

The Walker NPC template is only available in UEFN. However, you can access general grid islands for The Walking Dead Universe and its feature set in Fortnite Creative. To create the Walker NPC, you must use UEFN to access the [NPC Spawner device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-npc-spawner-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and [NPC Character Definition](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-npc-character-definitions-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

To get the best experience from the template, use the editor and an instance of the Fortnite game client (session) together. From the Fortnite session, you can see Walkers in action, try out weapons, and read in-editor guides.

Work in live edit mode to add items from the billboard instructions, and push the changes instead of opening and closing the game client. To enable live edit mode: in the toolbar click the **Launch Session** dropdown menu, and toggle **Live Edit**.

To learn more about pushing changes and working in the live edit mode, see [Playtesting Your Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/playtesting-your-island-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

## Walker Setup

The first demo area introduces you to Walkers and new weapons. Follow the in-editor guides to get acquainted with Walker's unique animation, gameplay, and sound, along with how to set them up. The Walker NPC is part of the [NPC Spawner device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/using-npc-spawner-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and [NPC Character Definition](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/using-npc-character-definitions-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite), which are only available in UEFN.

To create a Walker NPC in the template, follow these steps:

**WalkerDefinition** is a character definition created by the design team at Epic for the template that uses the default Walker modifiers based on the Walking Dead Universe. The WalkerDefinition asset is located in **Content Drawer > [Project Name] > AI**.

To create your own character definition, follow these steps:

Alternatively you can do the following:

- Drag the character definition directly into your island to spawn Walkers. The action creates an NPC Spawner device with the character definition automatically attached.
- From the **Details** panel of the **NPC Spawner**, click the **NPC Character Definition** dropdown, and choose **Create New Character Definition**. Double-click the icon to open the character definition.

Walkers are slow but overwhelming in numbers. The NPC Spawner device includes options in the Details panel to adjust properties like how many Walkers spawn at the start and over time. In the character definition, the **Walker** and **Walker (Prisoner Uniform)** types include a **Walker Gameplay Modifier** option for adjusting attributes like attack and bite damage.
