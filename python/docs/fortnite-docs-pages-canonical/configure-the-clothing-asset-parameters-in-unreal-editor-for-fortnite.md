# Configure the Clothing Asset Parameters

Configure the parameters of the cloth asset to ensure proper functionality.

![Configure the Clothing Asset Parameters](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dba290fc-fae8-4b10-be27-44e2bd0238e8?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

After creating your clothing asset, you next need to transfer skin weights and set various configurations for animations and physics.

## Transfer Skin Weights and Set Max Simulation Distance

In this section, you will transfer the skin weights from your skeletal mesh to the cloth collection. The skin weights tell the cloth mesh how to deform to conform to the skeletal mesh.

You will also add a **Max Distance Configuration**. The Max Distance value informs how far the simulated cloth can move away from its animated skinned position during simulation.

1. Drag from the **Collection** pin and search for then select **TransferSkinWeights**.

   [![Add a TransferSkinWeights node and set the Skeletal Mesh](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f4f1ca91-fd17-4045-8a35-4542ce025ca6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f4f1ca91-fd17-4045-8a35-4542ce025ca6?resizing_type=fit)
2. Drag from the **Collection** pin and search for then select **AddWeightMap**.

   [![Add a AddWeightMap node and set the Name to MaxDistance](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/52fb4eb6-d500-40cc-80c1-cfe2da26e66c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/52fb4eb6-d500-40cc-80c1-cfe2da26e66c?resizing_type=fit)
3. With the node selected, you will see a 2D representation of your cloth mesh in the **Cloth Panel,** and the **Weight Map** tools and parameters in the **Cloth Mode Toolbar**.

   [![The Weight Map interface](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d0cf957a-3d22-4376-b6ec-de31d66ee722?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d0cf957a-3d22-4376-b6ec-de31d66ee722?resizing_type=fit)

   The Weight Map interface contains the following sections:

   | Field | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **1. Display mode** | You can select a Black and White or White and Red color map to represent the painted values. |
   | **2. Action Type** | Select between various tools, such as **Brush**, **Fill**, and **Gradient**. You can also select **Paint** or **Smooth** Brush Modes. |
   | **3. Brush** | Enter the **Brush Size**, **Attribute Value,** and **Strength** of the tool. |
   | **4. Filters** | Adjust the regions affected by your selected Action Tool when painting. |
   | **5. Query** | Displays the value (0 - 1) painted at the cursor location. |
   | **6. Operations** | Includes options to clear and invert your selection, as well as a flood fill and multiply. |
   | **7. Mesh Elements Visualization, Triangle Visibility** | Includes various settings to control which parts of the mesh are visible in the panel. |
   | **8. View** | Toggle between **2D Sim**, **3D Sim**, and **Render** inside the panel. |
   | **9. Cursor** | Represents the **cursor location** where you are painting values on the mesh. |
   | **10. Paint Weight Maps** | You can **Accept** or **Cancel** the Weight Map changes you applied to the mesh. |
4. With the **Brush** tool selected and an **Attribute Value** of **1**, paint over your cloth mesh where you want your cloth to have complete movement freedom. Recall that 0 means no movement (kinematic) and 1 represents full movement within the maximum distance.
