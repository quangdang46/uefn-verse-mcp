## Overview of the Tutorial Steps

Below is an overview of the steps you'll need to accurately recreate this island:

1. Create a new island using a [starter island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#starter-island).
2. Add and set up a Player Spawn Pad close to the firing line.
3. Add and set up two Item Spawners.
4. Add and set up an Item Granter.
5. Add and set up the Button device.
6. Add and set up the End Game device.
7. Add and set up the Timed Objective device.
8. Add and set up the Barrier device.
9. Add and set up the Shooting Range Gallery devices.
10. Change the **My Island** settings to set up the game.

## Create Your Island

Start with the **Grid Island** as your starter island. This tutorial uses **prefabs** and **galleries** from the **Tilted Towers** category, but any theme you pick will work. Which building pieces you use depends on the style of the game you want to create, so there is a lot of room for creativity here.

There are three main areas to consider in a shooting gallery: a spawn area where the player can gather their weapons, a firing line for the player to shoot their weapon from, and finally, an area for the target dummies. Add a barrier to prevent the player from getting too close to the targets.

[![shoot-those-dummies](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/51e1ffd5-5948-4e45-aba7-701e73375719?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/51e1ffd5-5948-4e45-aba7-701e73375719?resizing_type=fit)

## Add and Set up a Player Spawn Pad

Once you finish setting up your island, add a **Player Spawner** device on the island. Place the spawner near the firing line. The Shooting Gallery is usually a single-player game, but you can add more player spawners if you want players to compete for who gets the most points.

Follow the steps below to locate and place the device.

Click **OK** after changing your settings. Otherwise, your customized options will not be saved.

## Add and Set Up the Item Spawners

Add two Item Spawner devices to the level. The Item Spawners hold the weapons your player needs to pick up before starting the game.

Follow the steps below to locate and place the devices.

1. From Create menu, press the **M**key, then select the **Devices** category.
2. Locate **Item Spawner**, then place it out of the way of the player.
3. Customize the options as shown below. To speed up the process, set the options for the first Item Spawner, then **Copy** and **Paste** the device.

   [![Item Spawer](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bd670e1c-3793-4e60-9072-6fe181bb74bd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bd670e1c-3793-4e60-9072-6fe181bb74bd?resizing_type=fit)

   | Option | Value | Explanation |

## Add and Set Up the Item Granter

The **[Item Granter](using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** is used to grant extra ammunition to the player at the start of the game.

Follow the steps below to locate and place the device.

1. From Create mode, open the **Creative** menu, then select the **Devices** category.
2. Locate **Item Granter**, then place it out of the way of the player.
3. Customize the options as shown below.

   [![Item Granter](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d690ef4d-0bab-4e3b-b59a-535c98ef66f3?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d690ef4d-0bab-4e3b-b59a-535c98ef66f3?resizing_type=fit)

   | Option | Value | Explanation |
   | --- | --- | --- |

   | **Grant Item When Receiving From** | Channel 2 | When the player presses the button programmed to transmit on this channel, they receive the items in the granter. |
4. Click **OK** to save your options.
5. Drop ammo into the granter

## Add and Set Up the Button

The **[Button](using-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** activates other devices by transmitting a signal when the player interacts with it.

Follow the steps below to locate and place the button.

## Add and Set Up the Timed Objective

The **[Timed Objective](using-timed-objective-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** device counts down from 30 seconds and displays a HUD message once the button to start the game has been pressed.

Follow the steps below to locate and place the Timed Objective.

## Add and Set Up the End Game Device

The **[End Game](using-end-game-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** device determines when the [win conditions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#win-condition) are met. In this case, the game will end when the timer runs out. Follow the steps below to locate and place the End Game device.

## Add and Set Up the Barrier Device

The **[Barrier](using-barrier-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** keeps the player within the bounds you set and prevents them from getting too close to the target dummies. Place the barrier in a central area between the spawn pad and the firing line.

Barrier size is measured using the island's grid tiles: a barrier that is 1 unit of height by 1 unit of depth by 1 unit of width will cover one cube on your Grid Island.

[![Barrier grid](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ac39bfd2-1f0c-47d5-a392-30a23b9fbb3b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ac39bfd2-1f0c-47d5-a392-30a23b9fbb3b?resizing_type=fit)

The tutorial grid is 5 x 5 x 5.

Follow the steps below to locate and place the Barrier.

## Add and Set Up Target Dummies

Finally, place the **[Shooting Range Gallery](using-shooting-range-gallery-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** devices. The tutorial uses 5 static Target Dummies, but you can choose the target type you prefer. A Shooting Range Gallery device also comes with the option of a moving target.

Follow the steps below to locate and place the Shooting Range Gallery devices.

## Change My Island Settings

Some of My Island settings need to be customized to create this game experience.

Any settings not mentioned in the table below should be left in their default state.

| **Environment Damage** | Off | Prevents players from damaging the level around the dummies. |
| **Start with Pickaxe** | No | Players start without the pickaxe. |

### UI Tab

[![Settings UI](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/82459d32-2457-4d72-b340-c45ec89952fa?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/82459d32-2457-4d72-b340-c45ec89952fa?resizing_type=fit)

## Designer Tips

### Modified Scoring

**Additional Devices Required**

- 2 x [Score Manager](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-score-manager-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- 1 x [Target Dummy Track](using-shooting-range-gallery-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

In the above tutorial each dummy grants the player 1 point on knock down and 3 points on a bullseye knock down, with its default health set to 1. If you want your player to get points without having to knock down the dummies, you can change the target dummies' health to INFINITE, and make them transmit to two **[Score Manager](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-score-manager-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** devices.

The first score manager will track regular hits and the second will track bullseyes.

Try modifying the score each hit will grant. To make things more challenging, make the dummy move on a track, that way the player will want to alternate between hitting the moving dummy and the stationary ones.

Take a look at the tables below for the suggested modified options.

**Target Dummy Track**

[![Target dummy track](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c25b8e9b-692e-4ae3-9cea-da8fdeb5ea6e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c25b8e9b-692e-4ae3-9cea-da8fdeb5ea6e?resizing_type=fit)

| Option | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Target Type** | Pumpkin-head | This type of target is easier to hit when moving on a track. |
| **Health** | Infinite | Prevents the dummy from getting knocked down after being hit. |
| **Show Health Bar** | No | Removes the health bar. |
| **Time Before Pop-Up** | Never | The target does not pop up on its own unless the game is started. |
| **Start Position** | Down | The target dummy lays dormant until the player presses the button tho start the game, then they pop up. |
| **Enable When Receiving From** | Channel 2 | The target dummy becomes enabled once the player presses the button to start the game. |
| **Pop-Up When Receiving From** | Channel 2 | The target dummy pops up once the player presses the button to start the game. |
| **When Hit Transmit On** | Channel 5 | The target dummy transmits to the first score manager when a regular hit is registered. |
| **On Bullseye Hit Transmit On** | Channel 6 | The target dummy transmits to the second score manager when a bullseye hit is registered. |

[![score managers](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/eaf72660-1750-407d-b05f-300e4572e002?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/eaf72660-1750-407d-b05f-300e4572e002?resizing_type=fit)

### Use the Class Designer Device

**Additional Devices Required**

- 1 x [Class Designer device](using-class-designer-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

The **[Class Designer](using-class-designer-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** gives you a way to define a custom class with an initial set of attributes and an inventory loadout. For this shooting gallery, we can eliminate the need for item spawners and granters by defining what the player gets at the start of the game and by giving players infinite ammo. Start by replicating the modified options below.

[![class designer](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6ce19064-4d4b-4141-88c7-37eaa9a674cb?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6ce19064-4d4b-4141-88c7-37eaa9a674cb?resizing_type=fit)

| Option | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Class Identifier** | 1 | The options selected on this device affects all players designated as class 1. |
| **Equip Granted Item** | First Item | Equips the first item from the set of items dropped in the class designer. |
| **Infinite Ammo** | On | Grants class 1 players infinite ammo. |

Drop the weapons you would like your player to start with into the class designer device, just as you did for the item spawners and the granter.

[![class designer](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/38d1a4de-a9e4-4e8d-ae7e-956c8892f951?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/38d1a4de-a9e4-4e8d-ae7e-956c8892f951?resizing_type=fit)

Go back to **My Island** and select the **Game** tab. Change the **Default Class Identifier** to 1.

[![game settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1e20c678-dac5-4a16-94f4-f45ade793da1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1e20c678-dac5-4a16-94f4-f45ade793da1?resizing_type=fit)
