# Creature Spawner Devices

Use Creature Spawner Devices to spawn enemies that can attack players.

![Creature Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/807cd8d3-3ad7-4369-8ffd-d6df123f94bb?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)

The **Creature Spawner** is a device that can [spawn](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) one or more [creatures](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary), of one or more types, at selected time intervals. There are settings to define when the spawner should start spawning and when it should stop. You can set whether players can see the spawner and whether they are able to destroy it.

For help on how to find the **Creature Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.

However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use *italic* for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like type of spawner, type and number creatures spawned, how close players must get to trigger spawns, spawn range from the device, and whether creatures spawn through walls.

Additionally, there are some advanced options, like the wave timer, creature despawn details, whether the device is visible or destructible, and more spawn effect and location details.

You can configure this device with the following options.
