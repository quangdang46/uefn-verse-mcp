# fort_playspace interface

Learn technical details about the fort_playspace interface.

A nested container that scopes objects, style, gameplay rules, visuals, etc. All objects and players in an experience will belong to a fort_playspace. There is typically one `fort_playspace` for an entire experience, though this may change in the future as the platform evolves.

To access the `fort_playspace` for a `creative_device` use `creative_device.GetPlayspace`.
