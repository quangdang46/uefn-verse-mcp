# OnSimulate function

Learn technical details about the OnSimulate function.

Called when the component begins simulating within the scene.

- Use this to add asynchronous/suspends update logic for a component.
- `OnBeginSimulation` is guaranteed to run before `OnSimulate`.
- `OnSimulate` will be cancelled before `OnEndSimulation`

## Attributes, Specifiers, and Effects

### Specifiers

The following specifiers determine how you can interact with `OnSimulate` in your programs. For the complete list of specifiers, see the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).

| Specifier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `protected` | The identifier is only accessible in the current class and any subtypes. You can use this on classes, interfaces, structs, enums, non-module methods, and data. |
| `native_callable` | Indicates that an instance method is both native (implemented in C++) and may be called by other C++ code. You can see this specifier used on an instance method. This specifier doesn’t propagate to subclasses and so you don’t need to add it to a definition when overriding a method that has this specifier. |

### Effects

The following effects determine how `OnSimulate` behaves in your programs. For the complete list of effects, see the Effect Specifers section of the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).

| Effect | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `transacts` | This effect indicates that any actions performed by the function can be rolled back. The transacts effect is required any time a mutable variable (`var`) is written. You’ll be notified when you compile your code if the `transacts` effect was added to a function that can’t be rolled back. Note that this check is not done for functions with the `native` specifier. |
| `suspends` | Indicates that the function is async. Creates an async context for the body of the function. |
| `no_rollback` | This is the default effect when no exclusive effect is specified. The `no_rollback` effect indicates that any actions performed by the function cannot be undone and so the function cannot be used in a failure context. This effect cannot be manually specified. |
