Learn technical details about the PlayReaction function.
Request to play a given reaction on the sidekick. This reaction is not guaranteed to play immediately; instead, the StartPlayReactionEvent should be used to monitor this. This will fail if the Sidekick cannot play the given reaction.

## Attributes, Specifiers, and Effects
### Specifiers
The following specifiers determine how you can interact with `PlayReaction` in your programs. For the complete list of specifiers, see the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).
Specifier | Meaning
---|---
`override` | Indicates that this child class provides a different method implementation than the parent class.
`native` | Indicates that the definition details of the element are implemented in C++. Verse definitions with the `native` specifier auto-generate C++ definitions that a developer can then fill out its implementation. You can use this specifier on classes, interfaces, enums, methods, and data.
### Effects
The following effects determine how `PlayReaction` behaves in your programs. For the complete list of effects, see the Effect Specifers section of the [Specifiers Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).
Effect | Meaning
---|---
`transacts` | This effect indicates that any actions performed by the function can be rolled back. The transacts effect is required any time a mutable variable (`var`) is written. You’ll be notified when you compile your code if the `transacts` effect was added to a function that can’t be rolled back. Note that this check is not done for functions with the `native` specifier.
`decides` | Indicates that the function can fail, and that calling this function is a [failable expression](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/failure-in-verse#failableexpression). Function definitions with the `decides` effect must also have the `transacts` effect, which means the actions performed by this function can be rolled back (as if the actions were never performed), if there’s a failure anywhere in the function.
