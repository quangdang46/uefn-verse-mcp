# Explosive Devices
Make things go boom!
![Explosive Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f8d6a9bc-2506-4899-9b12-54abee46b557?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
When activated, the **Explosive** device causes damage to whatever is in its blast radius.
There are several ways you can set it to be triggered:
  * From player interaction
  * By setting up [event binding](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) and activating it from another device
  * By setting a timer to detonate it after a specific time, or on a timed delay

You can also set this device to ignore damage from specific teams.
For help on how to find the Explosive device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.
However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use italic for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
The device can be customized to alter settings such as the blast radius and the [knockback](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) amount. You can also set a delay between the device being triggered and the explosion.
The default values are **bold**. Values that use [contextual filtering](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) are in italics.
