# PinBrawl Island Tutorial
Using pinballs, brawl your way to victory by collecting coin-granting orbs to purchase weapons and battle rivals.
![PinBrawl Island Tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/442a1201-3a92-494b-8ae9-e6024f05e305?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
PinBrawl is not a solo game and is meant to be played with two to four players.
In this three-part tutorial, you will create an angled pinball stage along with a brawl arena and a pre-game lobby. Players will use the **Baller Device** to run over coins and collect as much gold as they can. This gold can be used to purchase weapons for the final brawl.
Players will start their gameplay in the pre-game lobby and learn the rules of the game while they wait. After the autostart, players will respawn on the pinball arena and automatically teleport into their Baller vehicles. They can then use the vehicle to collect as many coins as they can.
The pinball round will last for two minutes. After the round ends, players will be teleported out of their vehicles and into the brawl arena. In the brawl arena, players will rush to purchase weapons and then battle for victory.
The [island code](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/playing-games-in-fortnite-creative) for this tutorial is **5433-9518-6615**.
To play through this island, click **CHANGE** in the **Fortnite Lobby** screen. On the Discover screen, click the **Island Code tab** and enter the code for the Hoverboard Racing Island. Once you've seen all the gameplay features, you can explore this tutorial and recreate it on your own island.

    1. Customize its options as shown below.
[![Player Spawn Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/fec97a56-cf5c-479b-99dc-ba1425d4b983?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/fec97a56-cf5c-479b-99dc-ba1425d4b983?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Explanation
---|---|---
**Priority Group** |  Primary |  Once the game countdown finishes, players will spawn on the pads set as primary.
**Use As Island Start** |  No |  Players will not initially spawn on these pads. They will instead spawn in the pre-game lobby.
**Visible During Games** |  No |  This device will be invisible during gameplay.
**When Player Spawned Transmit On** |  Channel 1 |  A signal will be sent to another device that will receive the signal and then trigger an action. Each pad will have a different channel number.
  3. With your phone tool equipped, right-click to copy the spawn pads and place them a good distance apart from each other.
a. For each pad, change the setting **When Player Spawned Transmit On** to a new, unused channel. For example, the second spawn pad will be set to Channel 2 and the third pad will be set to Channel 3.

In the bottom right corner of the **My Island** tab, click **Channel Browser** to view used channels.
This step is important as it sets the device to send a signal to the baller vehicle that automatically pushes players into it. After the game countdown, players will automatically sit in the device.
###  Baller Spawner
You will now place and customize the **Baller Spawner**.
[![Baller Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/be08e886-bca6-4e4b-8a0e-fe793e171d60?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/be08e886-bca6-4e4b-8a0e-fe793e171d60?resizing_type=fit)

Option  |  Value  |  Explanation
---|---|---
**Assigns Driver When Receiving From** |  Channel 1 |  Players will be pushed into the vehicle after receiving the signal sent from the Player Spawn Pad. The channels should match the corresponding spawn pad.
**Disable When Receiving From** |  Channel 5 |  Players will be pushed into the vehicle after receiving the signal sent from the Player Spawn Pad. The channels should match the corresponding spawn pad.
**When Players Exit Vehicle Transmit On** |  Channel 1 |  Players will be pushed back into the vehicle if they try to exit.

[![Completed Barrier Placement](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3cc3a017-7c30-4f41-929a-70b2caae2701?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3cc3a017-7c30-4f41-929a-70b2caae2701?resizing_type=fit)
With these devices, players cannot fly off of the arena as they swing and boost with their vehicles.
###  Designer Tips
Since players launch and fall from great heights, decorate the arena with a boundary to reassure players they wont fall off the arena.
It may be overwhelming for players to fall and launch at great heights with sky visuals. Assure players they won’t fall off the map by offering boundaries in the arena like in the photo below. They won't know there's a barrier device placed to keep them safe inside.
[![Arena Boundary](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d4004f48-4a03-4907-91a7-4c278bc6057c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d4004f48-4a03-4907-91a7-4c278bc6057c?resizing_type=fit)
Try adding colorful lights to your arena by using **Beacons** from the **Lights** category in the GALLERIES tab.
Especially if you placed **Music Blocks** as floor pieces when building the arena, use audio devices like **Radio** to play tunes throughout your arena. If you do, the radio will trigger visual effects with the music blocks.

###  Designer Tips
If you have added challenges to your arena, reward the players who overachieve with status buffs like **Slurp Mushroom** and **Jelly Bean** that will aid their gameplay.
To do so repeat the steps above to offer as an aiding reward. You can use a new item from the Collectibles Gallery to represent the rewarding items.
Be sure to place new Item Granters on unused channels for the setting **Grant Items When Receiving From**. This channel should match the setting **When Item Picked Up Transmit On** for the Collectibles Gallery item that you chose.

###  Designer Tips
You can edit this step to use only one weapon per Vending Machine. This way, players can purchase weapons faster.
You could also use the [**Conditional Button**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and Item Spawner instead of the Vending Machine. This pair of devices can be used for faster weapon granting as well.
You can also alter the required gold for each weapon to match the amount of gold granted per coin on your arena.
