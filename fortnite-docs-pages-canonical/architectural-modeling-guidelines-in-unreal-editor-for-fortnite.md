The **Verse Detonation Template** shows you how to create a game where two teams battle to arm and disarm bomb sites.
This tutorial uses the Verse device and basic devices such as the Map Indicator device to perform gameplay mechanics like making beacons show depending on conditions.
This template demonstrates Verse concepts like:
  * Enums
  * Concurrency
    * Race
    * Await
