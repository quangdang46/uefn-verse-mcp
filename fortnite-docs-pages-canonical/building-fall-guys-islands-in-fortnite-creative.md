# MetaSounds in UEFN
Use MetaSounds to create immersive audio in your UEFN experiences.
![MetaSounds in UEFN](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d249be14-15e9-4926-b429-786bcefd88fa?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
[MetaSounds](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/metasounds-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.5), the powerful audio system that provides node-based procedural sound design in Unreal Engine, is now available in UEFN as read-only. It replaces traditional static wave files with a flexible, modular approach, offering greater creativity and efficiency in sound design.
UEFN now has **two** exposed MetaSound source files, allowing you to make **MetaSound presets**. Currently, you cannot add your own [MetaSound nodes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/metasounds-reference-guide-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.5) in the MetaSound editor or edit the exposed MetaSounds graph. This is a first step in the process of fully exposing MetaSounds to UEFN creators.
##  Creating MetaSound Presets
Open a UEFN project, then in the Content Browser, navigate to **Epic** > **Audio** > **MetaSounds** > **Sources**.
You can also set the search filter to **Audio** > **MetaSound Source**.

Right-click one of the MetaSound Sources and select **Create MetaSound Source Preset**.

Select a location in your project folder and press **Save**.
A MetaSound Preset maintains a reference to the base MetaSound Source and allows you to override settings, including adding your own sound waves and modifying other properties.
##  The MetaSound Sources
The two exposed MetaSound Sources are **MSS Play Random Loop** and **MSS Play Random Oneshot**.

Once you have created the presets in your project folders, you can use the **MSS Play Random Loop** as a simple looping MetaSound that randomly selects from an array of Sound Waves. Parameters to randomize the volume and pitch of the sounds are also exposed.
**MSS Play Random Oneshot** is a one-shot variant but otherwise identical.
To edit any of the properties, click **Override Inherited Default** , then make your own selections or add your own sound wave files.

##  Playing the MetaSound Presets
MetaSound Presets inherit from SoundBase and are playable using [Audio Devices in UEFN](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/audio-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).
