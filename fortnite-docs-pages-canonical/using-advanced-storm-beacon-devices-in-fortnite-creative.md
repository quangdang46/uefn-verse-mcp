![Chair Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e5cc6a2d-54b0-4e59-bf99-6f4f366b1479?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Chair** device provides a way to place and keep players in a seated position, limiting or changing their ability to move the camera so you can focus the player's view on something specific.
Ways you can use this in your islands include:
  * Cinemas
  * Concerts or other virtual events
  * Terminal/PC interactions
  * Restaurants
  * Roller coasters or other rides

The device has multiple chair types available, and chairs can also be set to invisible.
If you are using the Chair device in a [UEFN](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) project, you can also set the **Chair Model** option to **Custom** , and use a custom [mesh](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#mesh) and [material](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#material) for your chair.
To find the Chair device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
##  Contextual Filtering
Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use _italic_ for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.
##  Device Options
You can configure this device with the following options.
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
Option  |  Value  |  Description

**Interact Time** |  Do Not Interact**,****_Instant_** , Pick or enter an amount of time |  Determines the amount of time the player must hold the interaction control before they sit down in the chair. When set to the default, or when you set an interaction time, two additional options display. If you select **Do Not Interact** , those options don't display.
**Interact Radius** |  **Don't Override** , Pick a radius |  This determines how far away a player can be and still interact with the device, as measured in meters.
**Interact Angle** |  **45** , Pick an angle |  This determines the angle of space, anchored at a device. A player must be in this angle of space to interact with the device. If this is set to its maximum of 180 degrees, that you can interact with the chair from any direction.
**Activating Team** |  **Any** , Pick a team |  Determines which team can activate the device.
**Invert Team Selection** |  On, **Off** |  If set to **On** , all teams can activate the device except the team selected in the **Activating Team** option. This is **Off** by default.

**Player Exit Enabled** |  **On** , Off |  Determines whether players can exit the chair on their own.
**Camera Collision** |  On, **Off** |  Determines whether the chair will block the camera for players sitting in it. If the chair is invisible, camera collision is disabled for everything within a 40 cm radius from the seating position.
**Play Seated Audio** |  **On** , Off |  Determines whether an audio effect is played for entering and exiting the chair.
**Interact Text** |  **Sit** , Enter text |  Determines the text players will see on the interaction prompt for the chair. The text field has a character limit of 150.
**Dismount Direction** |  Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Enter Direction, **Camera Facing** |  Determines the direction the player is launched when dismounting the chair.  If set to Enter Direction, this determines the direction which players entered the chair. If set to Camera Facing, players are launched in the direction of the character's camera is currently facing. This option is limited to the interaction angle of the chair.
**Dismount Force** |  500 cm/s, Select a force amount |  Determines the force with which the character launched when dismounting the chair, in the direction specified by Dismount Direction.
**Dismount Upwards Force** |  250 cm/s, Select an upwards force amount |  Determines the force with which the character launched when dismounting the chair, directly upwards.
##  Direct Event Binding

  1. For any function, click the **option** , then **Select Device** to access and select from the **Device** dropdown menu.
  2. Once you've selected a device, click **Select Event** to bind the device to an event that will trigger the function for the device.
  3. If more than one device or event triggers a function, press the **Add** button to add a line and repeat these steps.

Option  |  Description
