# The Audio Mixer Device
Adjust volumes of sound groups using the Audio Mixer device.
![The Audio Mixer Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ffc1f2c1-272e-4e78-8a1a-f649f0328aca?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
Use the **Audio Mixer** device to adjust the volume for groups of sounds with dynamic and automatic control of a game’s volume mix, much like a professional mixing console would.
With the Audio Mixer, you can adjust the level of sounds that are already in Fortnite (such as weapons, character footsteps, and vehicles) as well as custom [sound waves](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#sound-wave) and [sound cues](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#sound-cue) by using [**control buses**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#control-bus) and [**control bus mixes**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#control-bus-mix).
The Audio Mixer is also available directly in Fortnite Creative. Check out the [Audio Mixer Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-audio-mixer-devices-in-fortnite-creative) for more info.
Jump to [Activate Mix for a Duration](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-audio-mixer-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) for a step-by-step guide on activating a mix for a short duration on your island.
##  Control Buses
When a sound is set to use a **control bus** , all the sounds on that bus can be modulated together in a **Control Bus Mix**.
The following control buses are available to control the volume of the sounds that occur in Fortnite by default:
Control Bus Name  |  Description
---|---
CB FortAmbient |  Used to set the volume of FN ambient sounds.
CB FortExplosions |  Used to set the volume of FN explosion sounds.
CB FortFootstep |  Used to set the volume of character footsteps.
CB FortGadgets |  Used to set the volume of sounds associated with FN Creative gadgets and devices.
CB FortGlobal |  Used to set the volume of all FN sounds.
CB FortHitNotify |  Used to set the volume of sounds associated with the Player getting impacted.
CB FortImpacts |  Used to set the volume of impact sounds.
CB FortJam Volume |  Used to control the volume of Jam tracks.
CB FortMusic |  Used to set the volume of music (includes emote music).
CB FortPatchwork Volume |  Used to set the volume of Patchwork devices.
CB FortVehicles |  Used to set the volume of vehicle sounds (not including engine sounds).
CB FortVehicles Engine |  Used to set the volume of vehicle engines.
CB FortWeapon |  Used to set the volume of weapons.
You can also create your own control buses. To create a control bus:
  1. In the **Content Browser** , with the project content folder selected, click the **+Add** button or right-click in an empty space in the Content Browser to bring up a context menu.
  2. Under the **Create Advanced Assets** section, click **Audio > Modulation**, then click**Control Bus**.
  3. Enter a name for your new **control bus**.
  4. Open the **Control Bus** asset and set the **Parameter to Volume**

To use a control bus on custom audio assets, the control bus must be set on the sound wave asset. The sound wave can still be used on a sound cue and the effect will be applied.
To add a control bus to your sound wave:
  1. In the **Content Browser** , open the sound wave you want to add to a control bus to.
  2. Under Modulation, set **Volume Routing** to **Override**.
  3. Click the **Modulate** checkbox.
  4. Add one or more **control buses** to the **Volume Modulators** array.

##  Control Bus Mixes
**Control bus mixes** take a group of control buses and allow you to define the volume level for each control bus.
To create a control bus mix:
  1. In the **Content Browser** , with the project content folder selected, click the **+ Add** button or right-click in an empty space in the Content Browser to bring up a context menu.
  2. Under the **Create Advanced Assets** section, click **Audio > Modulation**, then click**Control Bus Mix**.
  3. Enter a name for your new **control bus mix**.

Control bus mixes can also be created directly from the Mixer device.
Control bus mixes take an array of **mix stages**. Each mix stage has the following parameters:
Parameter  |  Description
---|---
Bus |  A control bus. Can be a Fortnite-defined bus or a user-created one.
Value |  The volume of the sounds routed to this control bus should be scaled when a mix is activated.
Attack Time (sec) |  [Attack](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#attack) is the time in sections for the mix to be applied when the mix is activated.
Release Time (sec) |  [Release](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#release) is the time in sections for the mix to be applied when the mix is deactivated.

##  Activate a Mix for a Duration
For this example, let's prototype a Hide and Seek game. Footsteps are muted while players look for a hiding spot, and once the timer runs out, everything is fair game! These four devices are required to test this example:
  * Player Spawner
  * Audio Mixer
  * Timer
  * Round Settings

[![Timer Example](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/10c7e169-951b-4c38-8c6a-b3b2a5a222bc?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/10c7e169-951b-4c38-8c6a-b3b2a5a222bc?resizing_type=fit)
  1. Select and drag the **Audio Mixer** device into the viewport.
  2. In the **Details** panel, assign **CBFortFootstep** in the Bus field.
  3. Set **Fader Value** to **0.0**.
  4. Check **Activate on Game Start**.
[![CBFortFootstep](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5ddfd174-a233-4894-b826-a248fb21663e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5ddfd174-a233-4894-b826-a248fb21663e?resizing_type=fit)
  5. Select a **Timer** device and drag it into your scene.
  6. Customize the device settings as you see fit for your island. In this example, **Duration** is set to **30.0**.
