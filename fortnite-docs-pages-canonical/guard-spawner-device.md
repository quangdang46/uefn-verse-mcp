![Conversation Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a6db2942-55b3-4b39-ad9c-0ebad6e85f37?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Conversation device** is a tool you can use to create interactive conversations between players and NPCs during gameplay. Keep reading to see some creative ways to make the most of this device on your own island.
Because conversation trees cannot be built in Creative, you can only use a Conversation device with Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). For more on this device, see [Conversations](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/conversations-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

The Conversation device is perfect for livening up your characters by providing interactions with players. In this example, you’ll use the **Character** device with the **Conversation** device to make this happen.

###  Design Tip
The Conversation device can trigger any events from within the conversation, allowing all of these camera switches! Think of all of the other devices that can be connected to a conversation. Maybe monsters will spawn at a specific point in your conversation if the player picks the wrong option, or maybe the player will get a health boost if they correctly solve a riddle!
