# Viewport Toolbar
An reference for the viewport toolbar and its functionality with the Unreal Editor.
![Viewport Toolbar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f3b414c4-c262-45d1-b474-e1225fb76c39?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The **Viewport Toolbar** is located above the editor viewport. It includes quick-select tools and menu options that affect how you interact with objects, the level in general, and what you see there.
##  Improved Viewport Toolbar versus the Legacy Viewport Toolbar
This viewport toolbar replaces the previous viewport toolbar entirely for the Level Viewport and any other asset editors that also have a viewport.
[![The improved level viewport toolbar in Unreal Engine 5.6 and later compared to the legacy viewport toolbar found in earlier versions of Unreal Engine.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f8882768-bfd5-4bc7-af52-f4f4d917f40a?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f8882768-bfd5-4bc7-af52-f4f4d917f40a?resizing_type=fit) The improved level viewport toolbar in Unreal Engine 5.6 and later compared to the legacy viewport toolbar found in earlier versions of Unreal Engine.
This update to the viewport toolbar provides the following benefits:
  * It has consistent locations for features ordered by logical categories, such as those for transforms, snapping, and view modes.
  * Unification of related tools and options that were previously located in high-level settings dropdowns.
  * Better overflow management for smaller viewports as quick-select elements and menu condense and collapse into an overflow menu.
  * Unique toolbars for Level Editor Modes and asset editors with their own specific controls.

##  Viewport Toolbar Interface
The toolbar — whether it’s in the level editor or an asset editor — is located just above the viewport window.

##  Transform & Snapping Tools
The **Transform** and **Snapping** tools make up most of the tools you’ll use to select and manipulate objects within the editor viewport. This includes tools for selection, snapping, space orientation, and quick-select options for the most common ones.
###  Transform Tools
The **Transform** **tools** are a set of quick selection tools to move, rotate, and scale objects and set what space (local or world) these should operate in. These options are how you will interact with objects in the level. This part of the toolbar also includes a dropdown menu with additional transform-related options.
[![Viewport transform tools area](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c51bade2-796d-4113-8945-e6a6e6c9d11e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c51bade2-796d-4113-8945-e6a6e6c9d11e?resizing_type=fit) Viewport transform tools area

###  View Options
The **View** options are available when the viewport is using the **Perspective** view. These options configure the viewing angle of the viewport camera, and at what distance content should be visible from this camera.
[![Image of menu options for field of view.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/671b1515-7270-4e75-9ff6-ffb8dcd0614c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/671b1515-7270-4e75-9ff6-ffb8dcd0614c?resizing_type=fit)
This section includes the following settings:
Setting Name  |  Description
---|---
**Field of View** |  Sets the viewing angle of the viewport camera. This angle defines the extent of the world that is visible to the camera at any given time. The default is a **90 degree** viewing angle. Higher angles give you wider views to see more of the world but this skews the camera view. Lower angles show less of the world, feeling zoomed in, but the view of content is limited.
**Near View Plane** |  Sets the size of the plane used to clip through objects when the camera is close to a surface. Large values make the clip plane bigger to see through objects more easily.
**Far View Plane** |  Sets the far distance at which objects stop being rendered on screen. This value does not affect objects that have Nanite enabled.
In the example below, you can see how adjusting the field of view angle affectss your view:

###  Warning Indicators
When the interaction within a menu alters something critical that affects the viewport, such as a change that could cause visual or performative differences, actionable warning indicators appear in the viewport toolbar alongside the category they affect. This is helpful to indicate a change has occurred that can affect what you see in the viewport in some way.
For example, when **Realtime Viewport** is disabled, the warning indicator can clue you into the fact that the viewport isn’t updating what you see, which can have unintended consequences.
When these indicators are shown, you can click them to rest the changed setting to its default state, in turn removing the warning.

###  Other Editor Viewports
The **Viewport Toolbar** is adapted to different modes of the level editor and to the individual asset editors it has.
The sections below are some examples of these differences.
###  Level Editor Viewport Modes
The level editor can be put into different **Modes** to enable specialized editing interfaces and workflows for editing particular types of actors and geometry within the viewport.
You can change the level editor mode using the dropdown selection menu in the main toolbar.
[![Menu of categories you can select via the selection tool](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0da22bcc-4ed1-43b8-912b-f8ead53c7000?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0da22bcc-4ed1-43b8-912b-f8ead53c7000?resizing_type=fit) Menu of categories you can select via the selection tool
These modes change the primary behavior of the level editor viewport for a specialized task, such as moving and transforming assets in the world, sculpting landscapes, generating foliage, animating objects, and more.

For more information on these editor modes, see [Level Editor Modes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/level-editor-modes-in-unreal-engine) in the Unreal Engine documentation.
###  Asset Editors
Individual **Asset Editors** use a viewport toolbar adapted to their editors and functionality within.
In this example, you can see a comparison of the legacy viewport toolbar to the improved viewport toolbar.

Below are examples of the different viewport toolbars you’ll see in different editors:

###  Asset Editor Preview Scene Settings
**Asset Editor** viewports use a preview scene to display their assets. This scene can give you an idea of how that asset will look in a lit environment. You can change properties of the scene using the **Preview Scene Settings**.
You can access a portion of these settings from the viewport toolbar by clicking its menu.
