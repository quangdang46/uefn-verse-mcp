![Surfboard Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ad9a26b3-f271-437a-bd09-58e32f17701a?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
A **Surfboard Spawner** is a device that [spawns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#spawning) a Surfboard vehicle into the level at the spawner's given location and orientation. Use Surfboard Spawner devices in combination with the [Racing Checkpoint Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#race-checkpoint) to design a racing game for your players. You can place a player directly inside the Surfboard using a trigger.
To access the **E** key to open the CUSTOMIZE panel, you have to point your phone to the tip of the board. If you point it in the center, you'll only get the option to **RIDE** the board.
For help on how to find the **Surfboard Spawner** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
