# 34.30 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes
34.30 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes in Creative, Unreal Editor for Fortnite, and Verse.
![34.30 Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Release Notes](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7c6b7514-57e2-48fb-937b-df4c2a81bc0a?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The v34.30 update gives more control over matchmaking queues. Negan from The Walking Dead Universe arrives as an NPC, teaming up with players to fight Walkers, which now have customizable behavior.
A new tutorial teaches you how to create animated timers in UEFN.
Other additions include Fencing Fields Prefabs and Galleries, OG Weapons like the Zapotron and Guided Missile, and updates to devices like the Item Spawner and Reboot Van.
##  Creator Queue Controls MVP
Creators can now adjust how matchmaking queues behave. The Matchmaking Server (MMS) creates these queues when a party chooses to play an island in a public match and there is not an existing game session they can join. If, at any point, the number of players being sought is achieved, then the queue is flushed and the players in the queue are sent to the new game session. If the queue exists for too long and an acceptable queue has not been collected, then the queue will be canceled rather than starting a session that cannot properly function.
Matchmaking queues have 2 phases:
  * **Main phase** - If the queue fills for a full session then players are sent to a new match. If a match has not been made by the end of the main phase then the queue enters an Overtime phase.
  * **Overtime phase** - During the overtime phase a lower number of players can be targeted to attempt to get a satisfactory session started rather than canceling the queue. If, at the end of the queue's overtime phase, we have not reached the Minimum Players, the queue will be canceled. Otherwise, we will proceed into the match with the current queue.

New island settings have been added to enable creators to customize their queue:
  * **Queue Main Duration**
  * **Overtime Player Target**
  * **Minimum Players**
  * **Queue Overtime Duration**

The result is that creators now have the ability to control thresholds for their games. The base goal is always to prefer fuller matches, but, if a game has a very meaningful population point at which the island hits a better gameplay experience, then creators can use that as the Overtime Player Target, and fall back to that after a short wait for Max Players. Then, in cases where that fails, a fallback to a minimum player count occurs.
###  Private Match Exception
Since parties form their own match lobby, and launch the session themselves, these queue controls are not used for Private Matchmakes.
##  The Walking Dead Universe
###  Fight Walkers with Negan at your side!
Negan is now available as a character in the NPC Spawner. Fight side by side to take down Walkers with his best girl, Lucille, or with the Shiva Shotgun - which now has a flashlight, making it extra useful in those dark spaces.

Walkers now do more damage to each other if they’re on different teams, and they’ve had several cosmetic and animation upgrades to make them an even more interesting enemy. Remember that you can configure Walkers to behave in a variety of ways to make them fit your island’s gameplay!
Want to know more? The [Configuring Walkers page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/uefn/twdu-configuring-walker-npcs-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) documents how to change the look, feel, and behavior of Walkers, and the [Walker NPC Template doc](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/uefn/twdu-walker-npc-template-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) explains how to level up your [level design](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/uefn/the-walking-dead-universe-level-design-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to get the most out of your [hero weapons](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/uefn/the-walking-dead-universe-weapons-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).
Remember! You’ll be able to publish your The Walking Dead Universe islands starting May 16 via the Creator Portal. Release the horde of Walkers, and let players fight their way through your unique environments.

Learn how to create your own custom animated timer in UEFN. Make your racing games feel more engaging with a pulsing timer as the clock runs out, or apply the pressure to a free for all island with a clock face that changes color to warn players their time is almost up.

##  Scene Events in Scene Graph
[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f3c8cb77-0f9b-417b-9872-d80e0368e93f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f3c8cb77-0f9b-417b-9872-d80e0368e93f?resizing_type=fit)
Scene events are communication protocols that provide a way for different parts of a Scene Graph to talk to one another. Multiple components can respond to a scene event, and events can be sent up or down the hierarchy. It might be helpful to imagine a scene event as messages you can pass across the Scene Graph, giving each component an opportunity to respond to the message.
See the new document, [Scene Events](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation//uefn/scene-events-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite), to learn more about using and creating scene events. Follow along with the tutorial to better understand how scene events can be used to modify component behavior, or create a complex string of events in the scene.
##  ICYMI: Discover Performance Snapshot for Fortnite Creators
