# Armored Transport Spawner Devices
Use this armored transport to provide more opportunities for players to plan and perform heists on your island!
![Armored Transport Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/07407406-5867-417a-b35b-71424987a48e?resizing_type=fill&width=1920&height=335)
The Armored Transport Spawner gives you an armored truck, similar to what security companies use to move money from customers to banks. Spawned armored transports contain an embedded vault that works similarly to the Bank Vault device.
The armored transport can be driven by both players and AI characters, such as those created by Guard Spawner and NPC Spawner devices. The armored transport drives similarly to the Big Rig semi-truck vehicle, and holds a driver and one passenger.
Other things to keep in mind with this vehicle and its embedded vault:
  * You can determine which teams and classes are able to drive the armored transport, and which are able to break open the vault.
  * You can use most of the standard vehicle options to customize things like:
    * How much damage the vehicle does when it collides with players, other vehicles, or the environment
    * Whether the vehicle is destroyed when stuck underwater
    * Whether the vehicle spawns with modifications
  * You can determine whether your players need thermite to interact with the vault, or not.
  * You can manipulate the vault through functions and events.
  * You can manipulate the difficulty for opening the vault by increasing or decreasing the weakpoints' health, whether weapons can damage the weakpoints, and how quickly the weakpoints passively lose health.

For help with finding the **Armored Transport Spawne** r device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Contextual Filtering In Creative
Some devices are affected by a feature called contextual filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. To help identify them, values that trigger contextual filtering are in italic.All options are listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option's value, there will be a note about it in the **Description** field for that option.Device Options
Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are _italic_.
