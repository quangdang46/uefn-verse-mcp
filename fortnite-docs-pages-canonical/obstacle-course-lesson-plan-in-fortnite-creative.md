The **Siege Cannon** is a stationary heavy weapon that can deal massive area damage to players, vehicles, and the environment. You can also use it to launch players a great distance away, giving players another way to [traverse](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#traverse) an area and gain a tactical advantage. It can also be used for a fast escape!
For help on how to find the **Siege Cannon** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).
If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to rename them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
##  Device Options

##  Channels
When one device needs to "talk" to another device, it does so by [transmitting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) a [signal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) on a specific [channel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). The receiving device needs to be set up to [receive](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#receive) the signal on the same channel.
A channel is identified by a number, and channel numbers are customized for a device under the option that uses the channel. Most devices will also pass the identity of the player who [triggered](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) the device with the signal.
This device has receivers that perform a variety of functions when receiving a signal over a channel. Also, this device can transmit signals when certain conditions are met.

  6. Place a **Trigger** directly in front of the balloon. Rotate and resize it to match the image below, then customize it to the following settings:
[![Trigger Placement](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a3cb1d71-0844-4848-951c-dc181daabe28?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a3cb1d71-0844-4848-951c-dc181daabe28?resizing_type=fit)
[![Trigger Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/052f9656-98f8-4028-93f7-71a176e3152a?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/052f9656-98f8-4028-93f7-71a176e3152a?resizing_type=fit)
Option  |  Value  |  Description
---|---|---
Triggered by Player |  Off |  The Trigger should not be activated when a player walks over it.
Triggered by Damage |  On |  The Trigger will be activated when it is hit by a projectile from the Siege Cannon device.
Times Can Trigger |  1 |  The Trigger can only be activated once.
Visible in Game |  No |  The Trigger will be invisible so it feels like the player is shooting the balloon behind it.
Receive Damage While Invisible |  Take Damage |  This ensures that the Trigger will still be activated from damage even though it is invisible.
  7. Set the direct event bindings of the Trigger to the following:
[![Trigger Events](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8f3a79b5-6e88-45c8-9994-6b390023592c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8f3a79b5-6e88-45c8-9994-6b390023592c?resizing_type=fit)
Function  |  Device  |  Event  |  Description
---|---|---|---
On Triggered Send Event To |  ScoreManager10 |  Activate |  The player will be awarded 10 points for hitting a balloon.
On Triggered Send Event To |  BalloonPropManipulator |  Hide Props |  The balloon will be hidden when it is hit.
  8. Copy the entire balloon system (balloon, Prop Manipulator, and Trigger) and paste it two times in different locations in front of the Siege Cannon.
After selecting all of the individual elements of the balloon system, press a number key (1-8) to store the entire system in the toolbar, making it easier to place again later.
  9. Finally, modify the following Island Settings:
Modified Setting  |  Option  |  Explanation
---|---|---
HUD Info Type |  Score |  The player's score will be shown in the HUD.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A  |  Function  |  Device B  |  Event  |  Explanation
---|---|---|---|---
**ScoreManager10** |  Disable |  **BalloonTrigger1-3** |  On Triggered Send Event To |  The player will be awarded 10 points for hitting a balloon.
**BalloonPropManipulator1-3** |  Hide Props |  **BalloonTrigger1-3** |  On Triggered Send Event To |  The balloon will be hidden when it is hit.
You now have the base functionality for an aerial target practice island.
For additional difficulty, consider adding Prop Movers to the balloon and associated devices to make it move around the play area. Also, add more balloons that are further away and move more quickly, and give the player more points for hitting them.
Because the Siege Cannon has a very high range, it can be difficult for players to determine how to aim their shots. Consider using buildings and other structures around (and even in between) the balloons to give a sense of distance for the player.
The functionality shown here can be used to trigger a great deal of other effects as well. The player could shoot a target to trigger a door unlock, another platform moving, a new mechanic to become available, etc.
###  Breaking Buildings
Make building entries much more dynamic with the Siege Cannon!
**Devices used** :
  * 1 x **Siege Cannon**
  * 1 x [Player Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

Number of Guards |  2 |  The Guard Spawner will spawn two guards.
Total Spawn Limit |  2 |  Once two guards are spawned, no more will spawn.
Spawn Through Walls |  Off |  The guards must spawn within line of sight of the spawner, so they won't appear on the other side of walls.
Spawn Radius |  2.5M |  Guards will only spawn within this small radius, giving more control over their positions.
Visibility Range |  100M |  The guards will be able to detect the player from 100 meters away.
Drop Inventory On Elimination |  No |  The player already has a gun, so the guards do not need to drop their guns when they are eliminated.
  3. Outside of the building, place a **Siege Cannon** with default settings. Ensure that when the player is fired, they can reach the player-built wall on the building.
  4. Place an **Item Granter**. Give it a name you can recognize from a list. Drop an Epic Heavy Assault Rifle while standing next to the Item Granter to register the weapon. Customize it to the following settings:
[![Item Granter](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6c417f08-043a-4f20-b5d9-dfda10b187d4?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6c417f08-043a-4f20-b5d9-dfda10b187d4?resizing_type=fit)

  6. Finally, modify the following Island Settings:
Modified Setting  |  Option  |  Explanation
---|---|---
Environment Damage |  Player Built Only |  The player will be able to break through the player built wall but not the rest of the building.

Here’s an overview of how devices communicate in this Design Example:
Device A  |  Function  |  Device B  |  Event  |  Explanation
---|---|---|---|---
**WeaponItemGranter** |  Grant Item |  **PlayerSpawner** |  On Player Spawned Send Event To |  When the player spawns, they will be given the Heavy Assault Rifle.
You now have the base functionality for creating a building entry sequence using the Siege Cannon.
This technique is great for creating dynamic and exciting starting sequences for infiltration game modes. The destructive and movement-based capabilities of the Siege Cannon are also very useful in various PvP modes that utilize player building. Consider using the Siege Cannon in games where players may be using resources to create barricades or entire structures; a dramatic explosion and quick ambush could be the exciting addition that your game needs!

You now have the base functionality for an unlockable Siege Cannon upgrade.
For additional functionality, destroy the Siege Cannon after a specific amount of time to make the upgrade temporary. This can fit into many different elimination-based game modes, such as Free for Alls and Zone Capture games.
The movement functionality of the Siege Cannon also gives it an edge in maps that require strategic positioning, so consider movement carefully when deciding how and when to give players access to the Siege Cannon.
This example is built in a way that easily allows for additional upgrades to be added. Consider adding other devices or weapons that the player can unlock with the Gold coin they receive. Or, add other items that they will receive when completing other objectives, and create different rewards that they can unlock with different items.
